# NC-MCM-Visualizer 

## A toolbox to visualize neuronal imaging data and apply the NC-MCM framework to it

This is a toolbox uses neuronal & behavioral data and visualizes it. The main functionalities include: 
* creating different diagnostic plots and fitting a models on the data
* clustering datapoints into cognitive clusters using behavioral probability trajectories 
* testing and plotting probability of the cognitive sequence being a markov process of 1st order
* creating 3D visualizations using different sklearn dimensionality reduction algorithms as mappings
* the possibility to create a neural manifold using custom BunDLeNet's or any other mapping added
* creating movies and plots of behavioral/neuronal trajectories using the 3D mapping
