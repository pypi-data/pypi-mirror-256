A LibCST codemod to remove pytest fixtures applied via the `usefixtures` decorator,
as well as its parametrizations.

> [!NOTE]
> Only fixture usages will be removed, not its definition.

# Usage
This package requires Python >= 3.8. 

Install from PyPI into your project.

```shell
pip install pytest-fixture-remover
```

Run against your tests, specifying a fixture to remove.

```shell
python -m libcst.tool codemod.RemovePytestFixtureCommand my_project_tests/ --name clean_db
```

Before/after examples can be found in the `tests.test_command` module.

# Note on formatting
This codemod assumes that the target code is formatted with Black using
the magic trailing comma. It **may** change the existing formatting in several ways:
1. When removing a fixture name from the `usefixtures` call.
2. When removing a value that parametrizes the fixture via `parametrize`.

In both cases the behavior is the same and obey the following rules:
1. If there's only one item left after modifying, remove the trailing comma.
2. If there's multiple items left after modifying and the removed item was the last,
preserve the last item's comma (or its absense).
