.. py:class:: SPECTAttenuationTransform(attenuation_map = None, filepath = None, mode = 'constant', assume_padded = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of attenuation in SPECT. This transform accepts either an ``attenuation_map`` (which must be aligned with the SPECT projection data) or a ``filepath`` consisting of folder containing CT DICOM files all pertaining to the same scan

   :param attenuation_map: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to the attenuation coefficient in :math:`{\text{cm}^{-1}}` at the photon energy corresponding to the particular scan
   :type attenuation_map: torch.tensor
   :param filepath: Folder location of CT scan; all .dcm files must correspond to different slices of the same scan.
   :type filepath: Sequence[str]
   :param mode: Mode used for extrapolation of CT beyond edges when aligning DICOM SPECT/CT data. Defaults to `'constant'`, which means the image is padded with zeros.
   :type mode: str
   :param assume_padded: Assumes objects and projections fed into forward and backward methods are padded, as they will be in reconstruction algorithms
   :type assume_padded: bool

   .. py:method:: configure(object_meta, proj_meta)

      Function used to initalize the transform using corresponding object and projection metadata

      :param object_meta: Object metadata.
      :type object_meta: SPECTObjectMeta
      :param proj_meta: Projection metadata.
      :type proj_meta: SPECTProjMeta


   .. py:method:: forward(object_i, ang_idx)

      Forward projection :math:`A:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` of attenuation correction.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.
      :type ang_idx: torch.Tensor

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: backward(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Back projection :math:`A^T:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` of attenuation correction. Since the matrix is diagonal, the implementation is the same as forward projection. The only difference is the optional normalization parameter.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.
      :type ang_idx: torch.Tensor
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor

.. py:class:: SPECTPSFTransform(psf_meta = None, kernel_f = None, psf_net = None, assume_padded = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of PSF blurring in SPECT. The smoothing kernel used to apply PSF modeling uses a Gaussian kernel with width :math:`\sigma` dependent on the distance of the point to the detector; that information is specified in the ``SPECTPSFMeta`` parameter. There are a few potential arguments to initialize this transform (i) `psf_meta`, which contains relevant collimator information to obtain a Gaussian PSF model that works for low/medium energy SPECT (ii) `kernel_f`, an callable function that gives the kernel at any source-detector distance :math:`d`, or (iii) `psf_net`, a network configured to automatically apply full PSF modeling to a given object :math:`f` at all source-detector distances. Only one of the arguments should be given.

   :param psf_meta: Metadata corresponding to the parameters of PSF blurring. In most cases (low/medium energy SPECT), this should be the only given argument.
   :type psf_meta: SPECTPSFMeta
   :param kernel_f: Function :math:`PSF(x,y,d)` that gives PSF at every source-detector distance :math:`d`. It should be able to take in 1D numpy arrays as its first two arguments, and a single argument for the final argument :math:`d`. The function should return a corresponding 2D PSF kernel.
   :type kernel_f: Callable
   :param psf_net: Network that takes in an object :math:`f` and applies all necessary PSF correction to return a new object :math:`\tilde{f}` that is PSF corrected, such that subsequent summation along the x-axis accurately models the collimator detector response.
   :type psf_net: Callable

      :type proj_meta: SPECTProjMeta


   .. py:method:: _compute_kernel_size(radius, axis)

      Function used to compute the kernel size used for PSF blurring. In particular, uses the ``min_sigmas`` attribute of ``SPECTPSFMeta`` to determine what the kernel size should be such that the kernel encompasses at least ``min_sigmas`` at all points in the object.

      :returns: The corresponding kernel size used for PSF blurring.
      :rtype: int


   .. py:method:: _get_sigma(radius)

      Uses PSF Meta data information to get blurring :math:`\sigma` as a function of distance from detector.

      :type radius: float

      :returns: An array of length Lx corresponding to blurring at each point along the 1st axis in object space

      :type object: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: List of length ``batch_size`` corresponding to angle of each object in the batch
      :type ang_idx: Sequence[int]

      :returns: Object with PSF modeling applied

   .. py:method:: forward(object_i, ang_idx)

      Applies the PSF transform :math:`A:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis.

      :type ang_idx: int

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to n PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: backward(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Applies the transpose of the PSF transform :math:`A^T:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis. Since the PSF transform is a symmetric matrix, its implemtation is the same as the ``forward`` method.

      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.

      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to n PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:class:: CutOffTransform(proj = None, file_NM = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   proj2proj transformation used to set pixel values equal to zero at the first and last few z slices. This is often required when reconstructing DICOM data due to the finite field of view of the projection data, where additional axial slices are included on the top and bottom, with zero measured detection events. This transform is included in the system matrix, to model the sharp cutoff at the finite FOV.

   :param proj: Measured projection data.
   :type proj: torch.tensor

   .. py:method:: forward(proj)

      Forward projection :math:`B:\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{V}` of the cutoff transform.

      :param proj: Tensor of size [batch_size, Ltheta, Lr, Lz] which transform is appplied to
      :type proj: torch.Tensor

      :returns: Original projections, but with certain z-slices equal to zero.
      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: backward(proj, norm_constant = None)

      Back projection :math:`B^T:\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{V}` of the cutoff transform. Since this is a diagonal matrix, the implementation is the same as forward projection, but with the optional `norm_constant` argument.

      :param proj: Tensor of size [batch_size, Ltheta, Lr, Lz] which transform is appplied to
      :type proj: torch.Tensor
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.Tensor | None, optional

      :returns: Original projections, but with certain z-slices equal to zero.
      :rtype: torch.tensor
