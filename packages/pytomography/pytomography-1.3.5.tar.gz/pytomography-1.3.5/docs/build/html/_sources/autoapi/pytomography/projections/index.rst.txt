==================================

.. py:module:: pytomography.projections

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains classes/functionality for operators that map between distinct vector spaces. One (very important) operator of this form is the system matrix :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}`, which maps from object space :math:`\mathbb{U}` to image space :math:`\mathbb{V}`

.. py:class:: SystemMatrix(obj2obj_transforms, im2im_transforms, object_meta, image_meta)

   Abstract class for a general system matrix :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}` which takes in an object :math:`f \in \mathbb{U}` and maps it to a corresponding image :math:`g \in \mathbb{V}` that would be produced by the imaging system. A system matrix consists of sequences of object-to-object and image-to-image transforms that model various characteristics of the imaging system, such as attenuation and blurring. While the class implements the operator :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}` through the ``forward`` method, it also implements :math:`H^T:\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{U}` through the `backward` method, required during iterative reconstruction algorithms such as OSEM.

   :param obj2obj_transforms: Sequence of object mappings that occur before forward projection.
   :type obj2obj_transforms: Sequence[Transform]
   :param im2im_transforms: Sequence of image mappings that occur after forward projection.
   :type im2im_transforms: Sequence[Transform]
   :param object_meta: Object metadata.
   :type object_meta: ObjectMeta
   :param image_meta: Image metadata.

      :type object: torch.tensor[batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz]
      :param angle_subset: Only uses a subset of angles (i.e. only certain values of :math:`j` in formula above) when back projecting. Useful for ordered-subset reconstructions. Defaults to None, which assumes all angles are used.
      :type angle_subset: list, optional

      :returns: Forward projected image where Ltheta is specified by `self.image_meta` and `angle_subset`.
