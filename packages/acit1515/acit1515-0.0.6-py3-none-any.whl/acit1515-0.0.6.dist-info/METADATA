# ACIT 1515

### A test framework for ACIT 1515 - Scripting for IT

The framework relies on the following assumptions:

Assignments must consist of:

- Simple functions with no side effects
- Functions must not sys.exit, raise exceptions, or otherwise terminate the program
- Functions must not output or accept input. Input, output, and user interaction must be confined to `__main__` 

Test functions are organized in order of blocking requirements, where x is the maximum number of marks for the question, e.g.:

- First function tests if a value is returned (x marks deducted if failing)
- Second function tests if value is correct type (x - 1 marks deducted if failing)
- Third function tests is value is valid (x - 2 marks deducted if failing)
- etc.
