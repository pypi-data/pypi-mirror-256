Telingo is a solver for temporal programs. It leaverages clingo's input
language and scripting cababilities to parse and solve programs with
temporal formulas. As such the input of telingo is valid clingo input
supporting all clingo language features like for example aggregates;
only the way programs are grounded and solved is adjusted.
