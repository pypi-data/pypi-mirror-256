## Credit

The initial implementation of `anoncreds` / `indy-shared-rs` was developed by the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) team based at the Province of British Columbia, and derives largely from the implementations within [Hyperledger Indy-SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk). To learn more about VON and what's happening with decentralized identity in British Columbia, please go to [https://vonx.io](https://vonx.io).
