class Table:
  """Item collection with configurable strategies for insertion and sampling.

  A `Table` is the structure used to interact with the data stored on a server.
  Each table can contain a limited number of "items" that can be retrieved
  according to the strategy defined by the `sampler`. The size of a table, in
  terms of number of items, is limited to `max_size`. When items are inserted
  into an already full table the `remover` is used to decide which item should
  be removed.

  In addition to the selection strategies used to select items for retrieval and
  removal the flow of data is controlled by a `RateLimiter`. A rate limiter
  controlls high level relations between inserts and samples by defining a
  target ratio between the two and what level of deviations from the target is
  acceptable. This is particularily useful when scaling up from single machine
  use cases to distributed systems as the same "logical" throughput can be kept
  constant even though the scale has changed by orders of magnitude.

  It is important to note that "data elements" and "items" are related but
  distinct types of entities.

    Data element:
      - The actual data written using `Writer.append`.
      - Immutable once written.
      - Is not stored in a `Table`.
      - Can be referenced by items from one or more distinct `Table`.
      - Cannot be retrieved in any other way than as a part of an item.

    Item:
      - The entity stored in a `Table`.
      - Inserted using `Writer.create_item`.
      - References one or more data elements, creating a "sequence".

  The fact that data elements can be referenced by more than one item from one
  or multiple tables means thats one has to be careful not to equate the size of
  a table (in terms of items) with the amount of data it references. The data
  will remain in memory on the server until the last item that references it is
  removed from its table. Removing an item from a table does therefore not
  neccesarily result in any (significant) change in memory usage and one must be
  careful when selecting remover strategies for a multi table server. Consider
  for example a server with two tables. One has a FIFO remover and the other
  LIFO remover. In this scenario, the two tables would not share any chunks and
  would eventually consume twice the amount of memory compared a similar setup
  where the two tables share the same type of removal strategy.
