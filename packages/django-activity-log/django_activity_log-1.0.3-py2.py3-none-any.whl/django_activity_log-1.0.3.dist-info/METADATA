Forked from : https://github.com/scailer/django-user-activity-log

Changelogs of this fork is here:

you can set this integer in settings.py file
this constraint controls number of saving records with remove oldest records.

#### 3. ```EXCLUDE_IP_LIST```:

I changed this priority to find the IP address better. when you have a CDN , previous library saves IP address of CDN and it is not useful.
