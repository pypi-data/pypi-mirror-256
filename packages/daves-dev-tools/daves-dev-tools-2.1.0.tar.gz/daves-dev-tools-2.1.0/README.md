This project provides command line utilities for performing common python
development tasks.

## Installation

You can install daves-dev-tools with pip:

```shell
pip3 install daves-dev-tools
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```text
$ daves-dev-tools % daves-dev-tools -h
Usage:
  daves-dev-tools <command> [options]

Commands:
  git                         Tools for interacting with git repos.
  requirements                Tools for managing requirement versions.
  install-editable            Auto-discover and install packages in "develop"
                              mode used by the current environment or by one or
                              more specified packages/projects.
  make-typed                  Configure your project to indicate to `mypy` that

```

#### daves-dev-tools requirements update

Example:

```shell script
daves-dev-tools requirements update -aen all setup.cfg pyproject.toml tox.ini
```

The above command will update version specifiers for
all package requirements in your setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, and tox.ini files
to match currently installed versions of each distribution (matching existing
granularity, and only for *inclusive* specifiers—so where the comparator is
"~=", "==", ">=", or "<="—but not ">", "<", or "!=").

Help:

```text
$ daves-dev-tools requirements update -h
usage: daves-dev-tools requirements update [-h] [-i IGNORE]
                                           [-aen ALL_EXTRA_NAME] [-v]
                                           path [path ...]

positional arguments:
  path                  One or more local paths to a *setup.cfg* and/or
                        *requirements.txt* file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IGNORE, --ignore IGNORE
                        A comma-separated list of distributions to ignore
                        (leave any requirements pertaining to the package as-
                        is)
  -aen ALL_EXTRA_NAME, --all-extra-name ALL_EXTRA_NAME
                        If provided, an extra which consolidates the
                        requirements for all other extras will be
                        added/updated to *setup.cfg* (this argument is ignored
                        for *requirements.txt* files)
  -v, --verbose         Echo more verbose output
```

#### daves-dev-tools requirements freeze

```text
$ daves-dev-tools requirements freeze -h
usage: daves-dev-tools requirements freeze [-h] [-e EXCLUDE]
                                           [-er EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE]
                                           [-nv NO_VERSION]
                                           requirement [requirement ...]

This command prints dependencies inferred from an installed distribution or
project, in a similar format to the output of `pip freeze`, except that all
generated requirements are specified in the format "distribution-name==0.0.0"
(including for editable installations). Using this command instead of `pip
freeze` to generate requirement files ensures that you don't bloat your
requirements files with superfluous distributions.

positional arguments:
  requirement           One or more requirement specifiers (for example:
                        "requirement-name", "requirement-
                        name[extra-a,extra-b]", ".[extra-a, extra-b]" or
                        "../other-editable-package-directory[extra-a,
                        extra-b]) and/or paths to a setup.py, setup.cfg,
                        pyproject.toml, tox.ini or requirements.txt file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        A distribution (or comma-separated list of
                        distributions) to exclude from the output
  -er EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE, --exclude-recursive EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE
                        A distribution (or comma-separated list of
                        distributions) to exclude from the output. Unlike -e /
                        --exclude, this argument also precludes recursive
                        requirement discovery for the specified packages,
                        thereby excluding all of the excluded package's
                        requirements which are not required by another (non-
                        excluded) distribution.
  -nv NO_VERSION, --no-version NO_VERSION
                        Don't include versions (only output distribution
                        names) for packages matching this glob pattern (note:
                        the value must be single-quoted if it contain
                        wildcards)
```

#### daves-dev-tools install-editable

```text
$ daves-dev-tools install-editable -h
usage: daves-dev-tools install-editable [-h] [-r REQUIREMENT] [-d DIRECTORY]
                                        [-e EXCLUDE] [-ed EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY]
                                        [-edre EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION]
                                        [-dr] [-ie]

This command will attempt to find and install, in develop (editable) mode, all
packages which are installed in the current python environment. If one or more
`requirement` file paths or specifiers are provided, installation will be
limited to the dependencies identified (recursively) by these requirements.
Exclusions can be specified using the `-e` parameter. Directories can be
excluded by passing regular expressions to the `-edre` parameter. Any
arguments passed not matching those specified below will be passed on to `pip
install` (see `pip install -h` for additionally available arguments).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REQUIREMENT, --requirement REQUIREMENT
                        One or more requirement specifiers, requirement file
                        paths, or configuration file paths (setup.cfg,
                        setup.py, pyproject.toml, tox.ini, etc.). If provided,
                        only dependencies of these requirements will be
                        installed.
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        A directory in which to search for requirements. By
                        default, the directory above the current directory is
                        searched. This argument may be passed more than once
                        to include multiple locations.
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        A comma-separated list of distribution names to
                        exclude
  -ed EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY, --exclude-directory EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY
                        One or more glob patterns indicating directories to
                        exclude. This argument may be expressed as a path
                        relative to the current.
  -edre EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, --exclude-directory-regular-expression EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
                        Directories matching this regular expression will be
                        excluded when searching for setup locations This
                        argument may be passed more than once to exclude
                        directories matching more than one regular expression.
                        The default for this argument is equivalent to `-edre
                        '^[.~].*$' -edre '^venv$' -edre '^site-packages$'`.
                        Unlike for *--exclude-directory*, these expressions
                        apply only to the directory *name*, and no attempt to
                        resolve relative paths is made.
  -dr, --dry-run        Print, but do not execute, all `pip install` commands
  -ie, --include-extras
                        Install all extras for all discovered distributions
```

positional arguments:
  path        A project directory (where the setup.py and/or setup.cfg file are located)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

#### daves-dev-tools uninstall-all

```text
$ daves-dev-tools uninstall-all -h
usage: daves-dev-tools uninstall-all [-h] [-e EXCLUDE] [-dr]

This command will uninstall all distributions installed in the same environment as that from which this command is executed,
excluding any specified by `-e EXCLUDE`.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        One or more distribution specifiers, requirement files, setup.cfg files, pyproject.toml files, or
                        tox.ini files denoting packages to exclude (along with all of their requirements) from those
                        distributions to be uninstalled
  -dr, --dry-run        Print, but do not execute, the assembled `pip uninstall` command which, absent this flag, would be
                        executed
```
