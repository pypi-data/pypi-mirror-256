# XMLtoXSD Library

The `xmltoxsd` library is a Python tool designed to convert XML documents into XSD (XML Schema Definition) schemas automatically. It simplifies the process of generating XSD schemas from XML files, making it easier for developers to validate their XML data.

## Features

- **Automatic Type Inference**: Automatically determines the data types for XML elements and attributes.
- **Support for Complex XML Structures**: Handles nested elements and attributes with ease.
- **Customizable `minOccurs` Attribute**: Allows users to specify default values for `minOccurs` attribute in the generated XSD.

## Installation

Install `xmltoxsd` using pip:

```bash
pip install xmltoxsd
```

## Quick Start
Here's how to quickly get started with xmltoxsd:
```
from xmltoxsd import XSDGenerator

generator = XSDGenerator()
xsd_schema = generator.generate_xsd("path/to/your/xml_file.xml")
print(xsd_schema)
```

## Usage
To generate an XSD schema from an XML file:
```
with open("output.xsd", "w") as f:
    f.write(xsd_schema)
```
