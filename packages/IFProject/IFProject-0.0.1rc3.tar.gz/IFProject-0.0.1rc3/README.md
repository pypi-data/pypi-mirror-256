## Introduction
Welcome to IFProject, a Python-based story engine dedicated to creating and playing Interactive Fiction (IF). Utilizing the power of PyScript, IFProject allows you to run your interactive stories directly in the browser, providing an accessible and immersive experience for both creators and players of IF.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Internet browser

## Installation
1. **Install IFProject**: To get started, install IFProject via pip. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your system.
   ```
   pip install IFProject
   ```
2. **Running a Story**: Once installed, you can start playing an interactive fiction story by running the IFengine with your story file (in YAML format).
   ```
   IFengine mystory.yaml
   ```
   This command will serve your game on localhost, allowing you to play it in your browser.
