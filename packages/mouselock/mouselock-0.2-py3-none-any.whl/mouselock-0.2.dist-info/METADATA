Summary: A Python package for easily and programmatically locking your mouse.

Using this Python package, you can easily and programmatically lock your mouse to a point on your screen of your pick!

To use this package, you can simply initiate the "Lock" class/object. When doing so, the class/object will automatically initiate a Pynput controller. The class/object will also run on its own thread, meaning you can lock and unlock the mouse in your code with just one method.
