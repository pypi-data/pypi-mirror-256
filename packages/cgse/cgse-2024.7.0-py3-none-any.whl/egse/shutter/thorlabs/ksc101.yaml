Commands:

    # Each of these groups is parsed and used on both the server and the client side.
    # The group name (e.g. is_simulator) will be monkey patched in the Proxy class for the device or service.
    # The other field are:
    #   description:   Used by the doc_string method to generate a help string
    #   cmd:           Command string that will eventually be send to the hardware controller for the
    #                  device after the arguments have been filled.
    #   device_method: The name of the method to be called on the device class.
    #                  These should all be defined by the base class for the device, i.e. LakeShoreBase.
    #   response:      The name of the method to be called from the device protocol.
    #                  This method should exist in the subclass of the CommandProtocol base class, i.e.
    #                  in this case it will be the LakeShoreProtocol class.

    disconnect:
        description: Disconnect from the Shutter controller. This command will be send to the
                       Thorlabs Control Server which will then disconnect from the hardware controller.
                       This command doesn't affect the ZeroMQ connection of this Proxy to the
                       control server. Use the service command ``disconnect_cs()`` to disconnect
                       from the control server.

    connect:
        description:    Connect to the Thorlabs Shutter.

    reconnect:
        description:    Reconnect to the Thorlabs Shutter.

                        This command will force a disconnect and then try to re-connect to the controller.

    is_simulator:
        description:   Ask if the control server is a simulator instead of the real ShutterKSC01Controller class.
        returns:       bool | True if the far end is a simulator instead of the real hardware

    is_connected:
        description:   Check if the Thorlabs Hardware Controller is connected.

    set_mode:
        description:  Sets the KSC101 control mode.
                      Manual - In this mode, operation of the solenoid is via the top panel wheel.Move the wheel up to
                      open the solenoid (ON) and down to close (OFF).
                      Single - In this mode, the solenoid will open/close each time the top panel wheel ismoved up/down.
                      Auto - In this mode, the solenoid will open and close continuously after the toppanel wheel is
                      moved up. The ON and OFF times, and the number of cyclesperformed
                      Trigger - The K-Cube solenoid controllers have two bidirectional trigger ports(TRIG1 and TRIG2)
                      that can be used to read an external logic signal or outputa logic level to control external
                      equipment. By default, TRIG 1 is configured asan input and TRIG 2 as an output.
                      The active logic state can be selected Highor Low to suit the requirements of the application
        args:
          mode:       str | Available modes are "Manual", "Single", "Auto", "Trigger"
        cmd:          "{mode}"
        returns:      None

    set_enable:
      description:  This message sets the output state of the solenoid unit, and overrides any existing settings.
                    It can also be operated by the SET_CHANENABLESTATE message.
      args:
        status:     bool | True = open, False = closed
      cmd:          "{status}"
      returns:      None

    set_cycle:
      description:  Used to set the cycle parameters (On time, Off time, and number of cycles) that are applicable when
                    the solenoid controller is operating in one of the non‐manual modes (Single and Automatic mode
                    operations).
      args:
        on:         int | The duration of an on (open) state of the solenoid in ms ()
        off:        int | The duration of an off (closed) state of the solenoid in ms ().
        number:     int | The number of cycles from 0 to . If 0 is set then infinity cycles are foreseen in automatic
                    mode, the cycling can then be stopped with the set_enable command.
      cmd:          "{on} {off} {number}"
      returns:      None

    get_mode:
      description:  Retrieves the operating control mode of the KSC101 Controller.
      returns:      int | 1 = manual, 2 = single, 3 = auto, 4 = trigger, None = error

    get_enable:
      description:  Retrieves the shutter solenoid status.
      returns:      int | 1 = enabled (open); 0 = disabled (closed)

    get_cycle:
      description:  Retrives the the cycle parameters (On time, Off time, and number of cycles) that are applicable when
                    the solenoid controller is operating in one of the non‐manual modes (Single and Automatic mode
                    operations).
      returns:      dict |
