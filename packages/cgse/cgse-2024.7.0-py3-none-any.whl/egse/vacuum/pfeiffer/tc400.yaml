# The commands in this file are fake.
# One of the parameters of the command is the device index. If this is included here, the client
# will have to pass this argument for every function call. I prefer to add this on the
# controller side. Note that arguments must be included in the cmd string for the proxy interface.
# Additionally, this device requires a checksum that can only sensibly be calculated on the
# controller side as well.
