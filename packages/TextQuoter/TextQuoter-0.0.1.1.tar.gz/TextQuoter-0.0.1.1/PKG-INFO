# TextQuoter

TextQuoter is a versatile Python script designed to simplify the processing of quotation marks in a given string.

## Features

- **Removal of Unpaired Quotes:** TextQuoter ensures clean text by eliminating unpaired quotes.
  
- **Quotation Style:** Choose between the standard `“` and `”` or opt for a simplified style that uses `"`.

- **User-friendly Design:** TextQuoter features the `requoter` function, making it straightforward and easy to use for handling quotes with minimal effort.

## Installation

To use ``TextQuoter`` into your project, you need just to install it directly using ``pip install TextQuoter``.

## Usage Example
```python
from TextQuoter import requoter

# Sample text with mixed quotation styles
example = """Climbing the treacherous mountain, the group encountered a wise oracle. ”To reach the peak, you must answer my riddles," she proclaimed.
The bard grinned, ”"Riddles, you say? I've been waiting for this!\"."""

# Using default style
fixed_quotes_normal = requoter(input_text=example)

# Using simple style
fixed_quotes_simple = requoter(input_text=example, use_simple=True)
```
- In this example, the `requoter` function is applied to the sample text, demonstrating both the default and simple quoting styles.

#### Here is the what can be expected from the output:
- `fixed_quotes_normal`:
```
Climbing the treacherous mountain, the group encountered a wise oracle. “To reach the peak, you must answer my riddles,” she proclaimed.
The bard grinned, “Riddles, you say? I've been waiting for this!”.
```
- `fixed_quotes_simple`:
```
Climbing the treacherous mountain, the group encountered a wise oracle. "To reach the peak, you must answer my riddles," she proclaimed.
The bard grinned, "Riddles, you say? I've been waiting for this!".
```
