    """Calculate the Kronecker product of the input array.

    The Kronecker product of two arrays is defined as a tensor formed by taking
    all possible products of the elements of the input arrays. The resulting
    tensor will have dimensions equal to the element-wise product of the input
    array dimensions.

    For example, the Kronecker product of two 1D arrays `a` and `b` of length
    `n` and `m`, respectively, will be a 2D array of shape `(n, m)` where each
    element is the product of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. The
    Kronecker product of two 2D arrays `A` and `B` of shape `(n, m)` and `(p,
    q)`, respectively, will be a 4D array of shape `(n, p, m, q)` where each
    element is the product of the corresponding elements of `A` and `B`.

    Args:
        a (np.ndarray): The input array.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The Kronecker product of the input array. If the Kronecker product is
        symmetric, only the upper triangular part is returned. Otherwise, the
        full Kronecker product is returned as a flat array.
