FIGARO - Fast Inference for GW Astronomy, Research & Observations
=================================================================

| This documentation page is still under development. In the (hopefully) near future, I'll add some tutorials about how to include FIGARO in your own research project.
| In the meantime, please refer to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/sterinaldi/FIGARO>`_. Bug report is extremely appreciated.
| If you're curious about the other projects I'm working on or if you want to get in touch with me, feel free to visit `my website <https://sterinaldi.github.io>`_!
