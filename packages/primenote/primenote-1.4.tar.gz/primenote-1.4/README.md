# PrimeNote
PrimeNote is an intuitive sticky note-taking application for Linux and Windows. It allows the user to effectively edit, store and organize an infinite number of notes. PrimeNote supports various operation modes, such as `plain text`, `rich text`, `image`, `vim` or `console` (terminal emulator). It is well structured and fully featured, including;

- **Always on top** notes, without cluttering the taksbar
- **Druide Antidote** grammar tools built-in support (v9 and 10)
- **Smart formatting**, using 'enhanced plain text' where the input is standardized, yet allows basic text decorations
- **Cross-platform compatibility**, with official support for Linux and Windows 7-10
- **Neat organization**, with all data stored by folder structure using human-friendly formats
- **Fernet encryption**, to protect sensitive data
- **Quick search** built-in keyboard-driven tool to browse among note titles and content
- **Special paste** feature to quickly copy text from PDF documents
- **Images support**, with basic viewing features
- **Fully customizable** appearance, menus, hotkeys and mouse events
- **Cloud and virtual machine support**, edit a shared note repository in real time
- **Command-line interface** access to all notes (see `pnote -h`)

Its open source software is licensed under GPLv3.

# Getting Started â€” Installation
## Microsoft Windows
- For Windows 7 and above, download and execute the latest **[NSIS installer](https://gitlab.com/william.belanger/storage/-/raw/primenote/primenote-1.4.exe?inline=false)**

## Arch Linux
- Install `primenote-git` from the AUR
- Install `gvim` and `qtermwidget` community packages (optional)

## Debian
**PyPi package**
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools
sudo pip3 install primenote
```

**Vim and Console modes support**
- Install QTermWidget with PyQt bindings `QTERMWIDGET_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDING=ON`
- Install `vim-gtk` (with client-server mode enabled)

<br/>

# Advanced Features
## Customizable window styles and palettes
- All notes are decorated using CSS files located at the program root;
  - `ui/global.css`: defines the overall geometry and style for all notes
  - `ui/styles/*`: overrides and extend `global.css` attributes
  - `ui/palettes/*`: handles widgets and icons color schemes
- Users can extend those with custom palettes and styles, override or ignore them
- PrimeNote adds its own CSS selector `NoteDecorations` for enhanced customization

## Console mode
- In this mode, the text box is replaced with a native terminal emulator
- When a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is found, the file content is automatically executed in the terminal
- More QTermWidget color schemes can be added into `ui/terminal`
- For more details, see [QTermWidget GitHub Project page](https://github.com/lxqt/qtermwidget)

## Vim mode
- Provides a fully featured Vim instance in every note
- System-independent `vimrc` file and theme files
- Two-way communication between Vim servers and PrimeNote command-line interface
- Default settings allow for a seamless design between the text editing modes

## Cloud and virtual machine support
PrimeNote can be used simultaneously across two operating systems (OS) or onto a cloud drive. Thus, one can share a note folder with another user, a backup server or a virtual machine.<br/>

PrimeNote fully supports symbolic links (symlinks) on Linux, and partially on Windows. Hence, all notes can be stored in a remote location simply by replacing the notes repository folder with a symlink. Likewise, a symlink can be added into the repository. On Windows, however, please note that shortcuts do not equal symlinks, which require administrator privileges. Thankfully, PrimeNote provide a utility to ease the addition of symlinks into the note repository.

**Cloud storage**
- Install and configure a cloud drive software (ie. [RClone](https://rclone.org/), DropBox, Google Drive)
- Open a PrimeNote instance and go to `Settings > Advanced > Symbolic links`
- Click on `Create symbolic links`
- Select a cloud drive as the target, enter a name for the folder (ie. `Cloud`)
- Click on `Create symlink` then `Yes` in the user account control prompt (Windows only)

**Virtual machine**
- Create a symlink to the host notes repository
- Place it into a folder shared with the client machine
- On the client side, open a PrimeNote instance and right click on the tray icon
- Select `Open in a file manager`
- Replace the opened folder by the symlink, or add the symlink into it

**Limitations**
- `Rename` and `move` operations on symlinks will behave unexpectedly if used across two OS
- Nested symlinks are not yet supported on Windows

# Issues and bugs report
PrimeNote was developed on Windows 7 and Openbox using `tint2` panel. It will work with other desktop environment, but the system tray icon may behave unexpectedly on some. It should work fine with Mate and Windows 10, and be usable with KDE, Cinnamon and Xfce. Please report any bugs in the [issues](https://gitlab.com/william.belanger/primenote/-/issues) section, along with the last session log. The logs can be found in `~/.config/primenote/logs` on Linux and `C:\Users\<user>\primenote\logs` on Windows.
