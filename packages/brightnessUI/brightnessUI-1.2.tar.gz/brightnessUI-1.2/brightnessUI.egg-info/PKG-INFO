Description: # brightnessUI
        
        ## Introduction
        A simple UI to change screen backlight (brightness) for Ubuntu20.
        
        Purpose: An alternative for those computers with system brightness slider not working. This UI changes the backlight by modifying `/sys/class/backlight/xxx/brightness` directly, where `xxx` differs according to your computer.
