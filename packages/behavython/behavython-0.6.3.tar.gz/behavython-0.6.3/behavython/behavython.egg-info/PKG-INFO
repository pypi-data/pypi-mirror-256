<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<br/>

### About
- <span style="font-size:14px">This software was developed to be used in conjunction with <a href=https://bonsai-rx.org>Bonsai-RX</a> to extract behavior from video. It is a simple interface that allows the user to select the data and image files that were generated by Bonsai and then run the analysis. The results are saved in a csv file that can be used for further analysis. </span>
- <span style="font-size:14px">The software also implements bindings to the <a href=https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut>DeepLabCut</a> package, allowwing users to run the analysis using pretrained models on their data. </span>

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  - deeplabcut
  - seaborn
  - pyside6
  - openpyxl
  - scikit-image
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - tk
  - scipy

***For a simple way to keep up to date with requirements, reference the requirements.txt file***
### Installation as a pip package 
For the installation you need a simple command that you can get by one of two ways: 

 1. Copying and pasting from here:
	- "pip install behavython" (without quotation[""] marks)
 2. Going to the Pypi site and copying from there:
   	- [PyPi frontpage](https://pypi.org/project/behavython/)

_At the moment, Behavython was mainly tested on Windows_
<br/>
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
                                
- Windows

 1. Open the interface typing "behavython" on the command line
 	- If you installed it as a pip package you can just type "behavython" on the command line
 	- If you downloaded the source code you need to go to the folder where you downloaded it and type "python Bbehavython_front.py" on the command line

</p>

 2. Select all the photo-data pairs that you want to analyze
 	- In this step is important that you don't forget to verify that you got all the bonsai files, including the data and a image of the arena that you are analyzing

</p>

3. Wait for the program to finish the analysis
 	- Currently the program looks like it freezed when running. It is expected behavior but we are looking into it. Right now you only need to wait a little bit.

</p>

4. When finished the progress bar will show 100% and a preview of the results will be available on the right
