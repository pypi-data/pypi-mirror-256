This my first major project in Python that I am publishing to GitHub.
The main idea is that it will take any integer and draw it in roman numerals.
It can also convert roman numerals into integers, although the integers will be printed.
One other user side function allows the user to specify what numerals, what order and which size.
The URL for the GitHub is https://github.com/nicestuff77/roman-numeral
