About
-----

Sphinx BlueBrain Theme is a Sphinx theme based on the excellent *Material for
MkDocs* theme by Martin Donath (@squidfunk).

The `original theme <https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material>`__ is
licensed under the MIT license and is hosted on GitHub.

You can see examples (and the associated ``rst`` source) in the |sample| page.

Sphinx BlueBrain Theme is built through a combination of text replacement rules,
HTML template overrides, a small amount of additional CSS and Javascript, and
a python module which injects additional required context.
