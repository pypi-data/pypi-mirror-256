# Yasik: Optimization Pipeline Integration for Racecar Simulation
## Overview
Yasik is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to seamlessly connect optimization pipelines with racecar simulations. It provides a powerful and flexible interface to streamline the integration of optimization algorithms into the simulation environment, enabling efficient tuning and enhancement of racecar performance.
## Features
- Optimization Pipeline Integration: Yasik serves as a bridge between optimization algorithms and racecar simulations, facilitating the exchange of data and control commands.
- Parameter Configuration: Easily define and configure the parameters to be optimized in the racecar simulation. Yasik allows users to specify the variables subject to optimization and their respective ranges.
- Real-time Communication: The language supports real-time communication between the optimization pipeline and the racecar simulation, enabling dynamic adjustments and rapid iterations during the optimization process.
- Customizable Fitness Functions: Users can define and implement custom fitness functions tailored to their specific optimization goals. This allows for a wide range of optimization scenarios, from speed improvement to energy efficiency.
