Generate complex two-dimensional geometries for simulations based on mesh discretizations.

# Overview

With ParGeo you can create complex _domains_, where a domain is a two-dimensional geometry which is described by a collection of shapely [Polygons](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon) and [MultiPolygons](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.MultiPolygon.html#shapely.MultiPolygon) called _subdomains_.

This domain could then be used for mesh generation, to further perform 2D mesh based simulations, like the Finite Element Methods (FEM). We provide mesh generating functionalities based on [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info).

To generate the desired domain you will use the `pargeo.domain.Domain` class and sequentially add subdomains. Each subdomain is associated with a visibility level. The visibility level is an integer, and subdomains with a higher visibility level will cover those with a lower one and be merged with those having the same one.

Following features support you with the domain-generating process:

- **Create Geometries** (`pargeo.geometry`): 
    
    Create common geometries that can easly be transformed into shapely Polygons.

    Following geometries are provided:

    - Rectangle
    - Circle / Ellipse
    - Stellar
    - NStar
    - Raindrop 

- **Transform Geometries** (`pargeo.transform`)

    Pass transforms to your domain while adding new sub-domains. The sub-domain will then be first accordingly transformed before being added to the domain.

    Following transforms are provided:

    - Repeat
    - Periodic
    - Diffeomorphism

- **Impose Constraints** (`pargeo.constraint`)

    Pass constraints to the domain while adding new sub-domains. The new sub-domain is only added, if the constraints are met.
    
    Following constraints are provided:

    - DistanceConstraint
