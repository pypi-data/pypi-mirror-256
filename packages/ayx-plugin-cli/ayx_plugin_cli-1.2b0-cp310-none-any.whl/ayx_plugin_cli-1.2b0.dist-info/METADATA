# Alteryx Plugin CLI (ayx-plugin-cli)

## Overview

The AYX Plugin CLI is a command-line interface based on Typer, a tool that 
helps you build and manage custom plugins for Alteryx Designer. This 
top-level CLI oversees the creation and metadata of your plugins. It delegates 
the tasks of creating and building YXIs.
