        # SDK Builder (CircleCI Packer Port)
        
        This project takes runs entirely in CI and takes swagger inputs from MailSlurp (stored on s3) and generates clients
        for many languages. 
        
        It then runs bash scripts against the generated product to:
        
        - add license and readme etc
        - git tag and push
        - upload artifact to package manager
        
        See `.circleci/config.yml` for more.
