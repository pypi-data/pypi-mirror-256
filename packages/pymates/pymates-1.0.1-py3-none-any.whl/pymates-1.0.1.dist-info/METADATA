Simple encounter tracker I slapped together in 3 days.
Entirely programmed for android phones on an android phone.

No I'm not joking.

## Important:
The reason this needs root is because like all the other encounter trackers it works by taking captures of the screen. This is not usually possible on android because to capture the screen you must use the screenshot API which will only show content the app that requested the screenshot has rendered which is useless for this.

I solved this issue by using a command that's tucked away in the binaries of android "screencap" this returns an unadulterated screenshot but is only accessible via root.

The nature of this is somewhat of a security concern but these captures are immediately deleted after scanning for PokÃ©mon.

These captures never leave your device but as a precaution I still wouldn't leave it capturing if anything other than pokemmo is on screen.

You can toggle capture by pressing enter with no command typed in.

### I am not liable nor responsible if you brick your phone trying to root it! If you don't understand phone rooting then it's probably not a great idea to root your phone just for this. There are pros and cons to rooted android.

## Requirements:
