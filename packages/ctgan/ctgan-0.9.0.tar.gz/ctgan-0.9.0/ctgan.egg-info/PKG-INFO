Currently, this library implements the **CTGAN** and **TVAE** models described in the [Modeling Tabular data using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503) paper, presented at the 2019 NeurIPS conference.

# Install

## Use CTGAN through the SDV library

:warning: If you're just getting started with synthetic data, we recommend installing the SDV library which provides user-friendly APIs for accessing CTGAN. :warning:

The SDV library provides wrappers for preprocessing your data as well as additional usability features like constraints. See the [SDV documentation](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) to get started.

## Use the CTGAN standalone library

Alternatively, you can also install and use **CTGAN** directly, as a standalone library:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install ctgan
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge ctgan
```

When using the CTGAN library directly, you may need to manually preprocess your data into the correct format, for example:

* Continuous data must be represented as floats
* Discrete data must be represented as ints or strings
* The data should not contain any missing values

# Usage Example

In this example we load the [Adult Census Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)* which is a built-in demo dataset. We use CTGAN to learn from the real data and then generate some synthetic data.

```python3
from ctgan import CTGAN
from ctgan import load_demo

real_data = load_demo()

# Names of the columns that are discrete
discrete_columns = [
    'workclass',
    'education',
    'marital-status',
    'occupation',
    'relationship',
    'race',
    'sex',
    'native-country',
    'income'
]

ctgan = CTGAN(epochs=10)
ctgan.fit(real_data, discrete_columns)

# Create synthetic data
synthetic_data = ctgan.sample(1000)
```

*For more information about the dataset see:

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.

## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18

In this release we add a new TVAE model which was presented in the original CTGAN paper.
It also exposes more hyperparameters and moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor.

A new verbose argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new hyperparameter
called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control the number of optimization steps performed
in the discriminator for each generator epoch.

The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better readability and interpretability.

propertly support new types of data, such as categorical NaN values, as well as conditional
sampling and features to save and load models.

Additionally, the dependency ranges and python versions have been updated to support up
to date runtimes.
