# Hyper Shape recognition (HSR): A Versatile Similarity Measure for Chemical Systems

 HSR is a versatile tool for measuring similarity across a wide range of chemical systems. It enhances the robustness and versatility of the Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) method by incorporating multidimensional features for each atom, such as protons, neutrons, and formal charges.

## Getting Started

### Installing HSR

You can install HSR using either pip or conda:

```bash
pip install hsr
```
or 

```bash
conda install hsr -c conda-forge
```

### Basic Usage

Using HSR is straightforward:

```python
import hsr

mol1 = load_molecules_from_sdf('mol1.sdf')
mol2 = load_molecules_from_sdf('mol2.sdf')

similarity = compute_similarity(mol1, mol2)

```
For a detailed overview of HSR's methodology check our [documentation](https://marcellocostamagna.github.io/HSR/).
