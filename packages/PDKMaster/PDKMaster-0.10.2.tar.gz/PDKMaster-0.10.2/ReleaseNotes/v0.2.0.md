# v0.2.0 Release Notes

A lot of development has been going on and PDKMaster has been extended everywhere; the API is still extended and adapted based on the need of own projects using this framework. Use the git history for all the changes made.

One of the main changes for this version is that now CI and unit tests have been added to the repository. It's a first step to move from an experimental code base to one more targeted for long term software stability based on good software engineering practices. Also a first set of autodoc strings are provided for the classes in the framework and during the CI a first small subset of the reference documentation is built.

Other changes:
* added Bipolar primitive
* switch back to upstream PySpice, all needed changes have been merged into v1.5
* pdkmaster.io has also been restructued; now there is a submodule for each tool supported
and pdkmaster.io.export is gone.

The code base is still considered pre-alpha quality. The public release is here to give people a feel of what can be expected from the PDKMaster framework. The API is still fully in flux so projects using the code base now will likely need to significantly rework their code for future releases of the framework.
