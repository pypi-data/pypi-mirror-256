# Overview

The **Synthetic Data Vault** (SDV) is a Python library designed to be your one-stop shop for
creating tabular synthetic data. The SDV uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn
patterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.

## Features
:brain: **Create synthetic data using machine learning.** The SDV offers multiple models, ranging
from classical statistical methods (GaussianCopula) to deep learning methods (CTGAN). Generate
data for single tables, multiple connected tables or sequential tables.

:bar_chart: **Evaluate and visualize data.** Compare the synthetic data to the real data against a
variety of measures. Diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.

:arrows_counterclockwise: **Preprocess, anonymize and define constraints.** Control data
processing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization
and define business rules in the form of logical constraints.

# Install
The SDV is publicly available under the [Business Source License](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/main/LICENSE).
Install SDV using pip or conda. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with
other software on your device.

```bash
pip install sdv
```

```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge sdv
```

# Getting Started
Load a demo dataset to get started. This dataset is a single table describing guests staying at a
fictional hotel.

```python
from sdv.datasets.demo import download_demo

real_data, metadata = download_demo(
    modality='single_table',
    dataset_name='fake_hotel_guests')
```

![Single Table Metadata Example](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/stable/docs/images/Single-Table-Metadata-Example.png)

The demo also includes **metadata**, a description of the dataset, including the data types in each
column and the primary key (`guest_email`).

## Synthesizing Data
Next, we can create an **SDV synthesizer**,  an object that you can use to create synthetic data.
It learns patterns from the real data and replicates them to generate synthetic data. Let's use
the `FAST_ML` preset synthesizer, which is optimized for performance.

```python
from sdv.lite import SingleTablePreset

synthesizer = SingleTablePreset(metadata, name='FAST_ML')
synthesizer.fit(data=real_data)
```

And now the synthesizer is ready to create synthetic data!

```python
synthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=500)
```

The synthetic data will have the following properties:
- **Sensitive columns are fully anonymized.** The email, billing address and credit card number
columns contain new data so you don't expose the real values.
- **Other columns follow statistical patterns.** For example, the proportion of room types, the
distribution of check in dates and the correlations between room rate and room type are preserved.
- **Keys and other relationships are intact.** The primary key (guest email) is unique for each row.
If you have multiple tables, the connection between a primary and foreign keys makes sense.

## Evaluating Synthetic Data
The SDV library allows you to evaluate the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data. Get
started by generating a quality report.

```python
from sdv.evaluation.single_table import evaluate_quality

quality_report = evaluate_quality(
    real_data,
    synthetic_data,
    metadata)
```

```
Creating report: 100%|██████████| 4/4 [00:00<00:00, 19.30it/s]
Overall Quality Score: 89.12%
Properties:
Column Shapes: 90.27%
Column Pair Trends: 87.97%
```

This object computes an overall quality score on a scale of 0 to 100% (100 being the best) as well
as detailed breakdowns. For more insights, you can also visualize the synthetic vs. real data.

```python
from sdv.evaluation.single_table import get_column_plot

fig = get_column_plot(
    real_data=real_data,
    synthetic_data=synthetic_data,
    column_name='amenities_fee',
    metadata=metadata
)
    
fig.show()
```

![Real vs. Synthetic Data](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/stable/docs/images/Real-vs-Synthetic-Evaluation.png)

# What's Next?
Using the SDV library, you can synthesize single table, multi table and sequential data. You can
also customize the full synthetic data workflow, including preprocessing, anonymization and adding
constraints.

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* 🔄 Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.


# Release Notes

## 1.10.0 - 2024-02-15

This release adds multiple improvements to handling premium transformers and column relationships, including using premium transformers even if the PII flag is set to true. Additionally, the SDV now warns users to save the metadata after auto-detection has been used. Semantic sdtype detection has also been improved to tokenize column names to prevent unexpected substring matches.

This release also fixes a few warning bugs and fixes an issue that would cause `metadata.to_dict` to fail for metadata loaded from older versions of the SDV. A few synthesizer bugs were also resolved. The quality of the sequence_index for the `PARSynthesizer` has been improved, and an issue that would cause `CTGANSynthesizer`, `TVAESynthesizer`, and `CopulaGANSynthesizer` to crash if all columns were to be generated from scratch has been fixed.

* Update transformer assignment logic for handling pii - Issue [#1775](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1775) by @R-Palazzo

## 1.9.0 - 2024-01-11

This release makes a number of improvements. It introduces a new concept to the metadata known as column relationships! Column relationships can be used to define when certain groups of columns in a table should be treated as a special concept (eg. address). You can add a column relationship by using the new `add_column_relationship` method. The metadata detection was also improved by allowing semantic sdtypes (eg. 'email', 'phone_number') to be detected as primary keys.

This release also patches some bugs. An issue messing up the likelihood matching in the `HMASynthesizer` was resolved. The `CTGANSynthesizer` no longer fails when using the `FixedCombinations` constraint. The `Inequality` constraint was also patched to handle datetimes better.

### Deprecations

* The `set_address_columns` method is deprecated in favor of `add_column_relationship`.

### New Features

* Improve error messages for composite keys - Issue [#1684](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1684) by @frances-h
* Add column relationship validation to single table metadata - Issue [#1698](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1698) by @frances-h

* Fix _get_likelihoods not generating likelihood values - Issue [#1720](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/pull/1720) by @frances-h

## 1.8.0 - 2023-12-05

This release adds support for the new Diagnostic Report from SDMetrics. This report calculates scores for three basic but important properties of your data: data validity, data structure and in the multi table case, relationship validity. Data validity checks that the columns of your data are valid (eg. correct range or values). Data structure makes sure the synthetic data has the correct columns. Relationship validity checks to make sure key references are correct and the cardinality is within ranges seen in the real data.

Additionally, a few bugs were fixed and functionality was improved around synthesizers. It is now possible to access the loss values for the `TVAESynthesizer` and `CTGANSynthesizer` by using the `get_loss_values` method. The `get_parameters` method is now more detailed and returns all the parameters used to make a synthesizer. The metadata is now capable of detecting some common pii sdtypes. Finally, a bug that made every parent row generated by the `HMASynthesizer` have at least one child row was patched. This should improve cardinality.

### Maintenance

* Address `SettingWithCopyWarning` (HMASynthesizer) - Issue [#1557](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1557) by @pvk-developer
* Bump SDMetrics version - Issue [#1702](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1702) by @amontanez24

### New Features

* Allow me to access loss values for GAN-based synthesizers  - Issue [#1671](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1671) by @frances-h
* Create a unified `get_parameters` method for all multi-table synthesizers - Issue [#1674](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1674) by @frances-h
* Set credentials key as variables - Issue [#1680](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1680) by @R-Palazzo
* Identifying PII Sdtypes in Metadata - Issue [#1683](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1683) by @R-Palazzo
* Make SDV compatible with the latest SDMetrics - Issue [#1687](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1687) by @fealho
* SingleTablePreset uses FrequencyEncoder - Issue [#1695](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1695) by @fealho

### Bugs Fixed

* HMASynthesizer creates too much synthetic data (always creates a child for every parent row) - Issue [#1673](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1673) by @frances-h

## 1.7.0 - 2023-11-16

This release adds an alert to the `CTGANSynthesizer` during preprocessing. The alert informs the user if the fitting of the synthesizer is likely to be slow on their schema. Additionally, it is now possible to enforce that sampled datetime values stay within the range of the fitted data!

This release also makes internal changes to support address data in SDV Enterprise.

### New Features

* Add set_address_columns method - Issue [#1593](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1593) by @R-Palazzo
* Update_transformers should raise error on address columns - Issue [#1594](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1594) by @R-Palazzo
* add_constraints should raise error on address columns - Issue [#1595](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1595) by @R-Palazzo
* Print alert if CTGANSynthesizer is likely to be slow - Issue [#1658](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1658) by @fealho
* Set enforce_min_max_values to True for datetime transformers - Issue [#1676](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1676) by @R-Palazzo

### Bugs Fixed

* Can't set address columns after fitting - Issue [#1661](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1661) by @R-Palazzo

## 1.6.0 - 2023-11-07

This release improves user messaging in multiple ways. The most notable is that users will now see an alert if the `HMASynthesizer` is likely to be slow for their data's schema. Additionally, the logger messaging for constraints and the error messaging when setting distributions on non-parametric models was made more detailed.

The visualization plots in the `sdv.evaluation` sub-package all got a new parameter called `plot_type`, allowing the users to specify the plot type to use if the one being inferred is not useful. The `sdv.datasets.local.load_csvs` method now has a parameter called `read_csv_parameters`, that allow users to specify how the csvs should be read during loading. The same change was also made to the `sdv.metadata.multi_table.detect_table_from_csv`, `sdv.metadata.multi_table.detect_from_csvs`  and `sdv.metadata.single_table.detect_from_csv` methods.

Multiple bugs were resolved including one that caused new categories to be created during the sample step of `CTGANSynthesizer`.

## 1.5.0 - 2023-10-13

Several improvements and bug fixes were made in this release. Most notably, the metadata detection was substantially improved. Support for the 'unknown' sdtype was added, providing more flexibility in data representation. The software now attempts to intelligently detect primary keys and identify parent-child relationships in the metadata, streamlining the metadata creation process.

Additionally, issues related to conditional sampling with negative float values, the inability to update transformers for columns created by constraints, and compatibility with numpy version 1.25 and higher were addressed. The default branch was also switched from 'master' to 'main' for better development practices. Various bugs and errors, including those involving HMA and datetime format detection, were also resolved.

## 1.4.0 - 2023-08-23

This release makes multiple improvements to the metadata. Both the single and multi table metadata classes now have a `validate_data` method. This method runs checks to validate the data against the current specifications in the metadata. The `SingleTableMetadata.visualize` is also improved. The sequence index is now shown in the same section as the sequence key. It also now shows all key and index information (eg. sequence key, primary key, sequence index) in one section.

The `CTGANSynthesizer` has been made more efficient in the following ways:
1. Boolean columns are now being skipped during `preprocess` like categorial columns are.
2. It is possible to apply other transformations to categorical columns and have `CTGAN` skip the one-hot encoding step.

Additional changes include that the columns labeled with the sdtype `id` will now go through the `IDGenerator` transformer by default and constraint transformations that were being overwritten during sampling will now be respected.

### New Features

* Add validate_data method to Metadata - Issue [#1518](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1518) by @fealho
* Use IDGenerator for ID columns - Issue [#1519](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1519) by @frances-h

* Constraint outputs are being overwritten in DataProcessor.reverse_transform - Issue [#1551](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1551) by @amontanez24

## 1.3.0 - 2023-08-14

This release adds two new methods to the `MultiTableMetadata`: `detect_from_csvs` and `detect_From_dataframes`. These methods allow you to detect metadata for a whole dataset at once by either loading them from a folder or a dictionary mapping table names to the `pandas.DataFrames`. The `SingleTableMetadata` can now be visualized! Additionally, there is now a `summarized` option in the `show_table_details` parameter of the `visualize` methods. This will print each sdtype in the table and the number of columns that have that sdtype.

Additionally, this release patches a bug that prevented custom constraints from working on columns that were primary or alternate keys. It also adds support for Python 3.11!

This release adds a parameter called `verbose` to the `HMASynthesizer`. Setting it to True will show progress bars during the fitting steps. Additionally, performance optimizations were made to the modeling and initialization of the `HMASynthesizer`.

Multiple changes were made to enhance constraints. The `Range` constraint was improved to be able to generate more accurate data when null values are provided. Constraints are also now validated against the data when running `validate()` on any synthesizer.

Finally, some warnings were resolved.

## 1.1.0 - 2023-05-10

This release adds a new initialization parameter to synthesizers called `locales` that allows users to set the locales to use for all columns that have a locale based `sdtype` (eg. `address` or `phone_number`). Additionally, it adds support for Pandas 2.0!

Multiple enhancements were made to improve the performance of data and metadata validation in synthesizers. The `Inequality` constraint was improved to be able to generate more scenarios of data concerning the presence of NaNs. Finally, many warnings have been resolved.

## 1.0.1 - 2023-04-20

This release improves the `load_custom_constraint_classes` method by removing the `table_name` parameter and just loading the constraint
for all tables instead. It also improves some error messages as well as removes some of the warnings that have been surfacing.

Support for sdtypes is enhanced by resolving a bug that was incorrecttly specifying Faker functions for some of them. Support for datetime formats has also been improved. Finally, the `path` argument in some `save` and `load` methods was changed to `filepath` for consistency.

## 1.0.0 - 2023-03-28

This is a major release that introduces a new API to the `SDV` aimed at streamlining the process of synthetic data generation! To achieve this, this release includes the addition of several large features.

### Metadata

Some of the most notable additions are the new `SingleTableMetadata` and `MultiTableMetadata` classes. These classes enable a number of features that make it easier to synthesize your data correctly such as:

* Automatic data detection - Calling `metadata.detect_from_dataframe()` or `metadata.detect_from_csv()` will populate the metadata autonomously with values it thinks represent the data.
* Easy updating - Once an instance of the metadata is created, values can be easily updated using a number of methods defined in the API. For more info, view the [docs](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/data-preparation/single-table-metadata-api).
* Metadata validation - Calling `metadata.validate()` will return a report of any invalid definitions in the metadata specification.
* Upgrading - Users with the previous metadata format can easily update to the new specification using the `upgrade_metadata()` method.
* Saving and loading - The metadata itself can easily be saved to a json file and loaded back up later.

### Class and Module Names

Another major change is the renaming of our core modeling classes and modules. The name changes are meant to highlight the difference between the underlying machine learning models, and the objects responsible for the end-to-end workflow of generating synthetic data. The main name changes are as follows:
* `tabular` -> `single_table`
* `relational` -> `multi_table`
* `timeseries` -> `sequential`
* `BaseTabularModel` -> `BaseSingleTableSynthesizer`
* `GaussianCopula` -> `GaussianCopulaSynthesizer`
* `CTGAN` -> `CTGANSynthesizer`
* `TVAE` -> `TVAESynthesizer`
* `CopulaGan` -> `CopulaGANSynthesizer`
* `PAR` -> `PARSynthesizer`
* `HMA1` -> `HMASynthesizer`

In `SDV` 1.0, synthesizers are classes that take in metadata and handle data preprocessing, model training and model sampling. This is similar to the previous `BaseTabularModel` in `SDV` <1.0.

### Synthetic Data Workflow

`Synthesizers` in `SDV` 1.0 define a clear workflow for generating synthetic data.
1. Synthesizers are initialized with a metadata class.
2. They can then be used to transform the data and apply constraints using the `synthesizer.preprocess()` method. This step also validates that the data matches the provided metadata to avoid errors in fitting or sampling.
3. The processed data can then be fed into the underlying machine learning model using `synthesizer.fit_processed_data()`. (Alternatively, data can be preprocessed and fit to the model using `synthesizer.fit()`.)
4. Data can then be sampled using `synthesizer.sample()`.

Each synthesizer class also provides a series of methods to help users customize the transformations their data goes through. Read more about that [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthetic-data-workflow/transform-and-anonymize).

Notice that the preprocessing and model fitting steps can now be separated. This can be helpful if preprocessing is time consuming or if the data has been processed externally.

### Other Highly Requested Features

Another major addition is control over randomization. In `SDV` <1.0, users could set a seed to control the randomization for only some columns. In `SDV` 1.0, randomization is controlled for all columns. Every new call to sample generates new data, but the synthesizer's seed can be reset to the original state using `synthesizer.reset_randomization()`, enabling reproducibility.

`SDV 1.0` adds accessibility and transparency into the transformers used for preprocessing and underlying machine learning models.
* Using the `synthesizer.get_transformers()` method, you can access the transformers used to preprocess each column and view their properties. This can be useful for debugging and accessing privacy information like mappings used to mask data.
* Distribution parameters learned by copula models can be accessed using the `synthesizer.get_learned_distributions()` method.

PII handling is improved by the following features:
* Primary keys can be set to natural sdtypes (eg. SSN, email, name). Previously they could only be numerical or text.
* The `PseudoAnonymizedFaker` can be used to provide consistent mapping to PII columns. As mentioned before, the mapping itself can be accessed by viewing the transformers for the column using `synthesizer.get_transformers()`.
* A bug causing PII columns to slow down modeling is patched.

Finally, the synthetic data can now be easily evaluated using the `evaluate_quality()` and `run_diagnostic()` methods. The data can be compared visually to the actual data using the `get_column_plot()` and `get_column_pair_plot()` methods. For more info on how to visualize or interpret the synthetic data evaluation, read the docs [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/evaluation).

## 0.16.0 - 2022-07-21

This release brings user friendly improvements and bug fixes on the `SDV` constraints, to help
users generate their synthetic data easily.

Some predefined constraints have been renamed and redefined to be more user friendly & consistent.
The custom constraint API has also been updated for usability. The SDV now automatically determines
the best `handling_strategy` to use for each constraint, attempting `transform` by default and
falling back to `reject_sampling` otherwise. The `handling_strategy` parameters are no longer
included in the API.

Finally, this version of `SDV` also unifies the parameters for all sampling related methods for
all models (including TabularPreset).

### Changes to Constraints

* `GreatherThan` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Inequality`, which is
  intended to be used between two columns, and `ScalarInequality`, which is intended to be used
  between a column and a scalar.

* `Between` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Range`, which is intended to
  be used between three columns, and `ScalarRange`, which is intended to be used between a column
  and low and high scalar values.

* `FixedIncrements` a new constraint that makes the data increment by a certain value.
* New `create_custom_constraint` function available to create custom constraints.

### Removed Constraints
* `Rounding` Rounding is automatically being handled by the ``rdt.HyperTransformer``.
* `ColumnFormula` the `create_custom_constraint` takes place over this one and allows more
  advanced usage for the end users.

## 0.15.0 - 2022-05-25

This release improves the speed of the `GaussianCopula` model by removing logic that previously searched for the appropriate distribution to
use. It also fixes a bug that was happening when conditional sampling was used with the `TabularPreset`.

The rest of the release focuses on making changes to improve constraints including changing the `UniqueCombinations` constraint to `FixedCombinations`,
making the `Unique` constraint work with missing values and erroring when null values are seen in the `OneHotEncoding` constraint.

### Issues resolved

* Conditionally sampling on variable in constraint should have variety for other variables - Issue [#440](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/440) by @amontanez24

## 0.10.0 - 2021-05-21

This release improves the constraint functionality by allowing constraints and conditions
at the same time. Additional changes were made to update tutorials.

by @amontanez24
* Update benchmarking user guide for reading private datasets - Issue [#427](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/427)
by @katxiao

## 0.9.1 - 2021-04-29

This release broadens the constraint functionality by allowing for the `ColumnFormula`
constraint to take lambda functions and returned functions as an input for its formula.

It also improves conditional sampling by ensuring that any `id` fields generated by the
model remain unique throughout the sampled data.

The `CTGAN` model was improved by adjusting a default parameter to be more mathematically
correct.

Additional changes were made to improve tutorials as well as fix fragile tests.

## 0.9.0 - 2021-03-31

This release brings new privacy metrics to the evaluate framework which help to determine
if the real data could be obtained or deduced from the synthetic samples.
Additionally, now there is a normalized score for the metrics, which stays between `0` and `1`.

There are improvements that reduce the usage of memory ram when sampling new data. Also there
is a new parameter to control the reject sampling crash, `graceful_reject_sampling`, which if
set to `True` and if it's not possible to generate all the requested rows, it will just issue a
warning and return whatever it was able to generate.

The `Metadata` object can now be visualized using different combinations of `names` and `details`,
which can be set to `True` or `False` in order to display only the table names with details or
without. There is also an improvement on the `validation`, which now will display all the errors
found at the end of the validation instead of only the first one.

This version also exposes all the hyperparameters of the models `CTGAN` and `TVAE` to allow a more
advanced usage. There is also a fix for the `TVAE` model on small datasets and it's performance
with `NaN` values has been improved. There is a fix for when using
`UniqueCombinationConstraint` with the `transform` strategy.

## 0.8.0 - 2021-02-24

This version adds conditional sampling for tabular models by combining a reject-sampling
strategy with the native conditional sampling capabilities from the gaussian copulas.

It also introduces several upgrades on the HMA1 algorithm that improve data quality and
robustness in the multi-table scenarios by making changes in how the parameters of the child
tables are aggregated on the parent tables, including a complete rework of how the correlation
matrices are modeled and rebuild after sampling.

## 0.3.6 - 2020-07-23

This release introduces a new concept of `Constraints`, which allow the user to define
special relationships between columns that will not be handled via modeling.

This is done via a new `sdv.constraints` subpackage which defines some well-known pre-defined
constraints, as well as a generic framework that allows the user to customize the constraints
to their needs as much as necessary.

### New Features

* Support for Constraints - [Issue #169](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/169) by @csala


## 0.3.5 - 2020-07-09

This release introduces a new subpackage `sdv.tabular` with models designed specifically
for single table modeling, while still providing all the usual conveniences from SDV, such
as:

* Seamless multi-type support
* Missing data handling
* PII anonymization

Currently implemented models are:

* GaussianCopula: Multivariate distributions modeled using copula functions. This is stronger
  version, with more marginal distributions and options, than the one used to model multi-table
  datasets.
* CTGAN: GAN-based data synthesizer that can generate synthetic tabular data with high fidelity.
