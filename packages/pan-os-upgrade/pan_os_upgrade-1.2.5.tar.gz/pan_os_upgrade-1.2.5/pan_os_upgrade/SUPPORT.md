# Community Supported

This script solution is released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. This should be seen as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (PAN-OS and Panorama) by the script is still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the script itself.

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository (at [https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks)) or sites other than our official Downloads page on [https://support.paloaltonetworks.com](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com) are provided under the best effort policy.
