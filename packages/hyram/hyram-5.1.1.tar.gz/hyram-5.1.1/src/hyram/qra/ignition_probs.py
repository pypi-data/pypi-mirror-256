def get_ignition_probability(mass_flow_rate, mass_flow_thresholds, immed_ign_probs, delayed_ign_probs):
    """
    Get the ignition probabilities based on mass flow rate
    from a list immediate and delayed ignition probabilities
    that are separated into mass flow rate thresholds

    For the lists of ignition probabilities,
    the first value will be used if the input mass_flow_rate
    is less than the first (smallest) value of the mass_flow_thresholds,
    the last value will be used if the input mass_flow_rate
    is greater than the last (largest) value of the mass_flow_thresholds,
    and intermediate values will be used if the input mass_flow_rate
    falls within the values of the mass_flow_thresholds

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass_flow_rate : float
        Mass flow rate [kg/s] of interest

    mass_flow_thresholds : list of floats
        Sorted list of mass flow rates [kg/s] that separate the list of ignition probabilities

    immed_ign_probs : list of floats
        List of immediate ignition probabilities based on the mass flow rate thresholds 

    delayed_ign_probs : list of floats
        List of delayed ignition probabilities based on the mass flow rate thresholds

    Returns
    -------
    immediate_ignition_probability : float
        Probability of immediate ignition
    
    delayed_ignition_probability : float
        Probability of delayed ignition
