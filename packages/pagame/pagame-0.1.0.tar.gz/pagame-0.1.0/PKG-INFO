See and run '__main__.py'

Notes
-----
    Spotify should be open for the proper experience, but does not have to.

    In order for the game to access Spotify, you need to have a Spotify client id and secret. These
    can be obtained by creating a Spotify app (through 'developer.spotify.com'); and the client id
    and secret can be pasted directly in the script or placed in a folder within the root directory
    with names:

        ./secrets/
            spotify_id
            spotify_secret

    without any file extensions, and no new line at the end.

    When this is in order, run the 'play.py'-script from the root directory.

Parameters
----------
    DELAY           : Minutes between each game.
                      int or tuple
                        If a tuple, the game will start at a random time between the two values.

    LANGUAGE        : Language to play the game in.
                      str
                        Example: "en" for English, "no" for Norwegian.
