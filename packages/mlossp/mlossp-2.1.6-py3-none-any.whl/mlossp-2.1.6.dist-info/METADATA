              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Satellite Data Preprocessor

A package built for preprocessing netCDF, netCDF4, or GeoJSON files using spatial joins and concatenation to create time-series numpy and csv datasets.

### Keyword Arguments
* nc_config - Path to the configuration file used for loading nc files (only provide this if you are loading netCDF files.)
* record_out - A function to generate a label from a file name.
* region_out - A function to generate a label from a region data file name.
* out_out - A function that returns a string that is added to your output file.

### Usage:
* Define a directory structure and create the required configuration files. (see Configuration Files)
* Create an instance of Preprocessor and provide the path to a config json file along with keyword arguments.
* Call Preprocessor.preprocess to preprocess data according to the provided config.
* To define configurations for different data sources, use Preprocessor.preprocess_multi. Config_list[i] and Kwargs_list[i] will apply to the ith data source.

```python
import mlossp as sp

config_path = "config.json"
nc_config_path = "nc_config.json"
f = lambda : "_1"

preprocessor = sp.Preprocessor(
    config_path,
    nc_config=nc_config_path,
    out_out=f
)
preprocessor.preprocess()

config_list = ["config_1.json", "../configs/config_2.json"]
kwargs_list = [{"nc_config": nc_config_path, "out_out": f}, {}]
preprocessor.preprocess_multi(config_list, kwargs_list)
```

### Configuration Files

Every category of data - that is, data within a subdirectory - should have a json configuration file. The following keys should be defined within the configuration file:

* data_path - The path to the data directory, data_dir, regions_dir, and out_dir are the subdirectories of data_path that contain the satellite data, location data, and ouput data respectively.
* compress - Set to True to store all intermediate geojson files. Must be set to True for visualizations.
* crs - A geopandas supported coordinate reference system.
* regions_file_map - A mapping of region name to their file name in regions_dir.
* selected_regions - The list of regions to extract from the satellite data.
* join_on - The feature that duplicate data entries will be aggregated by.
* joins - The aggregate metrics that will be stored in the aggregate row. Each column will be named as the concatenation of the aggregate function and the original feature.
* file_extension - The format of all data being layered. This can be either *.pkl, *.json, *.nc4, or *.nc.

Given the following directory structure:
```text
- Data
    - EO
        - data1.nc
        - data2.nc
    - EO_OUT
    - Countries
        - gadm41_LKA_1.json
        - gadm41_USA_1.json
- preprocesser.py
```

And region and satellite data with the following features:
```text
Region: NAME, NAME_1, NAME_2, POINT, ...
Satellite Data: longitude, latitude, precipitationCal, ...
```

A sample configuration would be defined as follows:
```json
{
  "compress": true,
  "crs": "EPSG:4326",
  "data_path": "Data/",
  "regions_dir": "Countries",
  "data_dir": "EO",
  "out_dir": "EO_OUT",
  "regions_file_map":  {
    "Sri Lanka": "gadm41_LKA_1.json",
    "USA": "gadm41_USA_1.json"
  },
  "selected_regions": ["Sri Lanka"],
  "join_on": "NAME_1",
  "joins": {
    "precipitationCal": ["mean", "min", "max"]
  },
  "file_extension": "*.nc"
}
```

### Configuration Files for netCDF data
To use this package with netCDF data, a separate configuration must be provided for each data source. A sample configuration is shown below.
```json
{
	"latVar":"latitude",
	"lonVar":"longitude",
	"is360":false,
	"extraVars": ["NDVI"]
}
```

* latVar: The name of the latitude column
* lonVar: The name of the longitude column
* is360: Set to true if the netCDF contains data within 0 - 360 degrees
* extraVars: Desired features to be retrieved from the netcdf file.
