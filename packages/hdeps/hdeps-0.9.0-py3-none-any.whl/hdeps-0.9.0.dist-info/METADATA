# hdeps

Simple dependency not-a-solver lets you debug where backtracking would happen,
or figure out what would change on a platform that's not the same as you're
running right now.

This code was originally part of [honesty](https://pypi.org/project/honesty/)
but is easier to iterate on with pypi-simple as its source.

```sh
$ hdeps requests
...
$ hdeps --install-order requests
...
$ hdeps --have urllib3==1.999 requests
...
```


# Version Compat

Usage of this library should work back to 3.7, but development (and mypy
compatibility) only on 3.10-3.12.  Linting requires 3.12 for full fidelity.
