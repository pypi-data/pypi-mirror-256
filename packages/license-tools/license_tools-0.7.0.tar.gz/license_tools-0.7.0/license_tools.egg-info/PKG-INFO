# License tools

Collection of tools for working with Open Source licenses, focusing on Python packages.

## Features

At the moment, this primarily provides some convenience wrappers around the [ScanCode toolkit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/) by nexB Inc.

* Use *dataclasses* instead of dictionaries for returning data.
* Automatically download a specific Python package from PyPI and analyze it.
* Aggregate how often each license has been used inside the current artifact.
* Look into shared object files (`*.so*`) and ELF binaries to see what they are linking to (dynamically).
* Look into font files to easily analyze their metadata.
* Look into RPM file metadata.
* Recursively look into nested archives, for example by unpacking the actual upstream source code archives inside RPM (source) files.
* Make everything available from the terminal.
* Drop all confusing parameters.

## Installation

You can install this package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install license_tools
```

Alternatively, you can use the package from source directly after installing the required dependencies.

## Usage

To see the supported CLI parameters, just run:

```bash
python -m license_tools --help
```

Example: To see the licenses of a specific *joblib* package version, use something like this:

```bash
python -m license_tools --package "joblib==1.2.0"
```

If you want to use the package as a library, have a look at the `license_tools.retrieval.run` method for example to see how everything interacts.
