## Quick Start

- Install:

  ```shell
  pip install makex
  ```

- Define a Makex file (name it `Makexfile`):

  ```python
  #!makex
  
  target(
      name="hello-world",
      runs=[
          write("hello-world.txt", "Hello World!"),
  
          # or, you can use the shell, but it's not recommended:
          # shell(f"echo 'Hello World!' > {path('hello-world')}/hello-world.txt"),
      ],
      outputs=[
          "hello-world.txt",
      ],
  )
  ```

- Run makex and the target:

  ```shell
  makex run :hello-world
  ```
 
- A file at `_output_/hello-world/hello-world.txt` will have the following contents:

  ```
  Hello World!
  ```


## Limitations

- Mac support is not tested.
- Windows is not tested or supported (yet).
