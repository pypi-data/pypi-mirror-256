# Python packages

These packages were created using the poetry python package.

https://github.com/sdispater/poetry

To rebuild this package, clone the repo and install poetry.

The following commands at the project root will then be useful

* `poetry install` - grab and install all the dependencies necessary for building the package.
* `poetry build` - build the wheels and tar for the package
* `poetry publish` - publish the package to pypi

If you want to build your own package from scratch, the README for poetry is a good source.

## Usage

To use the package during a session:

`import jrwhypy`

### Data sets

The package has a data module for loading any data required.

e.g

`jrwhypy.data.load("bond")`
