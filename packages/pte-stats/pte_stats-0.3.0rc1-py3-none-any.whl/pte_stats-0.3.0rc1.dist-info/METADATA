# PTE Stats - Python tools for electrophysiology

PTE Stats is an open-source software package for statistics with time series.

It builds upon [PTE](https://github.com/richardkoehler/pte) and provides
statistical tools for time-series. PTE Stats is particularly useful with
intracranial EEG data such as local field potentials and electrocorticography.

## Installing pte-stats

### Stable release

To install the latest stable release, simply type:

```bash
$ pip install pte-stats
```

### Development version

To install the latest development version, first clone this repository:

```bash

```

If you are using conda, simply run:

```bash
$ conda env create -f env.yml
$ conda activate pte-stats
```

If you want to install pte-stats into an existing environment, type:

```bash

```

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute yourselves or to open an **issue** when you
encounter a bug or to request a new feature.

For any minor additions or bugfixes, you may simply create a **pull request**.

For any major changes, make sure to open an **issue** first. When you then
create a pull request, be sure to **link the pull request** to the open issue in
order to close the issue automatically after merging.

### How to contribute

To contribute yourselves, you should fork this repository, and then create a
development branch from your fork.

Then, inside your development branch run the commands:

```bash
$ conda env create -f env_dev.yml
$ conda activate pte-stats-dev
```

... or simply:

```bash
$ pip install -e .[dev]
