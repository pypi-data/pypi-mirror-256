# Print Cuneiform Numbers

This package converts numbers into cuneiform signs for 

The signs are represented as a string with unicode characters for [cuneiform signs](https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_12400.html).

The repository is available at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fhagelskjaer/print_cuneiform)

## Sumerian

The correct cuneiform signs are based on the book "Numerical Notation", by Stephen Chrisomalis.

With the deviation that the "ash" sign is used for one instead of the "gesh" sign.

If "gesh" should also be used for one simply set:

	"ash=False" in int_to_sumerian
 
The computation to sumerian cuneiform is done by removing the signs that are possible from the highest "sharu" to the lowest "gesh". The divisible sign sizes are:

	36000: 	sharu	𒐬
	3600: 	shar	𒄭
	600: 	geshu	𒐞
	60: 	gesh	𒐕
	10: 	u	𒌋
	1:	ash	𒀸

In case of negative numbers the "lal" sign is added in front:

	𒇲

## Installation:

To run the code unicode must be installed on the system:

	sudo apt install unicode

The library can the be installed as follows:

	pip3 install print_cuneiform

## Use:

	>>> from print_cuneiform.sumerian import int_to_sumerian
	>>> int_to_sumerian(1)
	'𒀸'
	>>> int_to_sumerian(71)
	'𒐕𒌋𒀸'
	>>> int_to_sumerian(-8, ash=False)
	'𒇲 𒐜'  
	
	int-to-sumerian -455
	
## Command line interface

The method can also be called from the command line, using either the 'ash' or 'gesh' for ones:

	int-to-sumerian -455
	'𒇲𒐛𒌋𒌋𒌋𒐃'
	int-to-sumerian-cla -455
	'𒇲𒐛𒌋𒌋𒌋𒐙'
