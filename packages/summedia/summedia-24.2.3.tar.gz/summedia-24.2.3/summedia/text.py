class Text(APIRequester):
    """
    A subclass of APIRequester specialized in text analysis and manipulation tasks.

    The Text class extends the functionality of the APIRequester to provide
    specific methods for handling various text-based operations. These operations
    include text summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, text simplification,
    and categorization. It utilizes an external AI model (accessible through the
    APIRequesters request_api method) to perform these tasks.

    Methods:
    - summarize_text: Summarizes a given text.
    - summary_article: Summarizes the content of an article from a URL or text.
    - analyze_sentiment: Analyzes the sentiment of a given text.
    - to_bullet_list: Converts text into a bullet-point summary.
    - translate_text: Translates text to a specified language.
    - adjust_text_complexity: Simplifies text to a specified complexity level.
    - tag_and_categorize_text: Analyzes text for key themes and categories.

    The class is designed to be used where text analysis and manipulation
    functionalities are required, leveraging the capabilities of an AI model.

        Summarizes the content of an article provided either through a URL or as a text string.

        This function attempts to fetch and summarize the article content from the given URL.

        passed as a text string.

                               If provided, the function fetches
                               the article text from this URL.
            article_text (str, optional): Direct text input of the article.
                                          This is used if `article_url`
                                          is not provided or the content could not be

        Note:
            The function prioritizes `article_url` over `article_text`.
