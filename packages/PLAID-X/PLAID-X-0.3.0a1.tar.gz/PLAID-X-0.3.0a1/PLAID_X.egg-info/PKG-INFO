# PLAID-X

This is a generalized version of [PLAID](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) and the previous ColBERT-X for CLIR.
The codebase supports models trained with the original ColBERT-X scripts, which are not compatible with the PLAID codebase released from the Stadford Futuredata Group.
