# py50

py50 is used to generate dose-response curves. The package can be installed using the following:

```
pip install py50
```

## Summary
The project was created for laboratory use. I found many of my classmates/coworkers were 
using a program that I found to be unfriendly to generate dose-response curves. I found
a few other repositories that can also generate dose-response curves in python, however,
they did not meet my requirements:
1. Use Pandas for the Data so that it can be plugged into a typical Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
2. Adaptable to user needs
3. Easy to use (hopefully!)

The curves are built on the four parameter logistic regression model:
$$Y = \text{Min} + \frac{\text{Max} - \text{Min}}{1 + \left(\frac{X}{\text{IC50}}\right)^{\text{Hill coefficient}}}$$
where min is the minimum response value, max is the maximum response value, Y is the response values of the curves, X 
is the concentration.  


This project meets our needs. And hopefully it can meet the needs of others.
