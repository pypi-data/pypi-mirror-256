## \brief   Create list of ECDF values.
#
#  This function creates the empirical cumulative distribution functions from a list of distances
#  and a list of bin values. That is, each element of the resulting list tells how many elements of
#  the distance list are smaller than the respective bin value.
#
#  \param   distance_list  List of distances to be grouped into the bins.
#  \param   bins           List of bins.
#  \retval  ecdf_list      Resulting list of amout of distances that are smaller than resp. bins.

## \brief   Assemble matrix of (generalized) distances between elemenst of datasets.
#
#  This function creates a matrix whose (i,j)th entry corresponds to the distance between element
#  i of a subset of dataset_a and element j of a subset of dataset_b. The respective subsets are
#  characterized by the indices of the respective first and last elements.
#  Notably, the matrix entries can be numbers or more general data types (such as lists). If
#  dataset_b is None, all entries of dataset_a in [start_a, end_a] are compared against one another.
#
#  \param   dataset_a      First dataset, whose subset is compared to second dataset.
#  \param   dataset_b      Second dataset, whose subset is compared to first dataset.
#  \param   distance_fct   Function generating a generalized distance between members of datasets.
#  \param   start_a        Starting index of considered subset of dataset_a. Defaults to 0. 
#  \param   end_a          Last (exclusive) index of consideres subset. Defaults to len(dataset).
#  \param   start_b        Starting index of considered subset of dataset_b. Defaults to 0. 
#  \param   end_b          Last (exclusive) index of consideres subset. Defaults to len(dataset).
#  \retval  distance_mat   Matrix of generalized distances.

## \brief   Assemble ecdf vector, whose elements are list of values for all subset combinations.
#
#  This function assembles a list of ecdf vectors for all possible combinations of subsets of the
#  dataset. Importantly, none of the subsets are compared to themselves and subsets i and j are
#  compared only once (not i with j and j with i).
#  The first dimension of the result refers to the index of the bin / ecdf vector. The second index
#  of the result refers to the subset combination.
#
#  \param   dataset        First dataset, whose subset are compared to one another.
#  \param   bins           List of bins.
#  \param   distance_fct   Function generating a generalized distance between members of dataset.
#  \param   subset_indices List of starting (and ending) indices of disjointly subdivided dataset.
#  \param   compare_all    If False, only subsets of different sizes are compared. Deafault: True
#  \retval  ecdf_list      ecdf vector enlisting values for subset combinations.
