## Overview

`lambchop` is an Python package that gives regular AWS Lambda asyncronous functionality by allow them to run background processes. This works by utilizing AWS Lambda [extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-extensions.html) which runs in a different process than the main lambda function code.


## Installation
pypi:

```
pip install lambchop
```

github:

```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/dave-lanigan/lambchop.git
```
```
pip install git+https://git@github.com/dave-lanigan/lambchop.git
```

> üìù Sudo privileges may be required because the lambda extension resides in the `/opt/extensions/` directory

## Usage

```
import time
from lambchop import SideKick

def long_running_process(x, y):
    print("Starting process 1.")
    time.sleep(x + y)
    print("Completed.")


def long_running_process2(x, y):
    print("Starting process 2.")
    time.sleep(x + y)
    print("Completed.")


def main():
    sk = SideKick()
    sk.add_task(long_running_process, x=5, y=3)
    sk.add_task(long_running_process2, x=5, y=3)
    sk.process()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
