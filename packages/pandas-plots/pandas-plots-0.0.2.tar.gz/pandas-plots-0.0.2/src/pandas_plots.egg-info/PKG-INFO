  - `pivot_df()` gets a pivot table of a 3 column dataframe

- `viz` utilities for plotly visualizations
  - `plot_box()` auto annotated boxplot w/ violin option
  - `plot_boxes()` multiple boxplots _(annotation is experimental)_
  - `plots_bars()` a standardized bar plot
  - `plot_stacked_bars()` shortcut to stacked bars ðŸ˜„
  - `plot_quadrants()` quickly show a 2x2 heatmap
