# BC En-De-Coder

BC En-De-Coder is a Python library that provides a secure way to encode and decode data for use with Large Language Models (LLM). The library allows you to protect sensitive information by passing a fake dummy value, which is then encoded and decoded to and from its original form after receiving a response from the LLM.

## Features

- **Secure Encoding and Decoding:** Protect your sensitive data by encoding it with a fake dummy value and decoding it back to the original form after interacting with an LLM.

- **Easy Integration:** Simple and easy-to-use functions for encoding and decoding data, making it convenient to integrate into your projects.

- **Customizable Encoding Parameters:** Fine-tune the encoding process with customizable parameters to suit your specific use case.

## Installation

To install BC En-De-Coder, you can use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install bc-en-de-coder
