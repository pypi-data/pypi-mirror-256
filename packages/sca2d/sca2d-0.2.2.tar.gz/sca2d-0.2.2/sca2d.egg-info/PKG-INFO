# SCA2D - Static Code Analysis for SCAD

![](identity/SCA2D.png)

This is an experimental linter for OpenSCAD. The focus is to properly lex the `.scad` files so that we can test for dangerous code like redefining variable from other scopes. SCA2D is in a very early stage of development.

## How to install

If you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine (and on the PATH) you can install SCA2D from PyPi by running the following command from a terminal

    pip install sca2d

to upgrade your current versions of SCA2D run:

    pip install sca2d --upgrade

You can check that SCA2D is installed by running the following:

    sca2d -h

you should see a help screen.

### Install issues

If you have problems with installation possible problems include:

* You may need to run `pip3` instead of `pip`
* Python may not be on the PATH, this often happens in Windows depending on how python was installed

## How to run

To analyse a `.scad` file run:

    sca2d filename.scad
This will print any code messages to the screen.

To analyse all `.scad` files in a directory run:

    sca2d directory_path
This will also print any code messages to the screen.

If you wish to inspect the parse tree that SCA2D generates and then uses you can instead run:

    sca2d --output-tree filename.scad
the tree will be printed into a file called `filename.sca2d`.

## What works

* Parsing most `.scad` files. We don't yet do extensive testing. Please raise an issue if you find a parsing error in SCA2D.
* Parsing included and used `.scad` files and checking variable, function, and module usage in different scopes.
* Checking for a minimal number of code errors

## How to get involved

The best way to get involved is to find bugs and then [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/bath_open_instrumentation_group/sca2d/-/issues). You could also make changes and open a merge request.
