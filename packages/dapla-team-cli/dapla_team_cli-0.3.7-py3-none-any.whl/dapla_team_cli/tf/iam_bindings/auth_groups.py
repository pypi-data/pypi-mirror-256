"""Auth groups represent a collection of users within a Dapla team.

These groups allow a team to be composed of users with different responsibilities. Each group is associated with roles
and permissions through IAM bindings. The team's administrators can dynamically decide which users should be
member of each auth group - as opposed to granting roles directly to specific users.

Thus, in order for a specific user to be granted a certain role, the user must be a member of the auth group.

Auth groups are named like so:
`<team-name>-<auth-group-simple-name>`

Examples:
    ```
    demo-enhjoern-a-managers
    demo-enhjoern-a-data-admins
    demo-enhjoern-a-developers
    demo-enhjoern-a-consumers
    demo-enhjoern-a-support
    ```

The master system for authorization groups is Active Directory (AD). The groups are automatically mirrored
into GCP as IAM groups.
