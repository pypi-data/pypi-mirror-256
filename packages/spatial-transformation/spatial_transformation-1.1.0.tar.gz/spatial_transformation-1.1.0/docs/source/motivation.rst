Why should I use Transform?
=====================================


#. Abstracts spatial transformation arithmetics into easily manageable code.

#. Supports translation and rotation in all common coordinate definitions. This includes **Euler Rotation**, **Quaternions** and **Rodrigues** for rotation and **Cartesian**, **Cylindrical** and **Spherical** for translation.

#. Provides a way of building a coordinate system hierarchy that allows easy transformation between different reference frames.
