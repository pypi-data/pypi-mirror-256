## Credits

Project is influenced by and borrowed from [woot](https://github.com/dearkafka/woot) and in fact started by using it as it is, but it didn't have support for Python 3.11 and VSCode didn't recognize resources and endpoints. So I made it with a straightforward approach without using dynamic attributes.
