# PFeed: Data Pipeline for Algo-Trading, Getting and Storing Real-Time and Historical Data Made Easy.

PFeed (/piː fiːd/) is a data integration library tailored for algorithmic trading, 
serving as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline between raw data sources and traders,
helping them in creating a local data lake for quantitative research.

PFeed allows traders to download historical, paper, and live data from various data sources, both free and paid,
and stores them into a local data lake using [MinIO](https://min.io/).

It is designed to be used alongside [PFund](https://github.com/PFund-Software-Ltd/pfund) — A Complete Algo-Trading Framework for Machine Learning, TradFi, CeFi and DeFi ready. Supports Vectorized and Event-Driven Backtesting, Paper and Live Trading.

## Project Status
**_Caution: PFeed is at a VERY EARLY stage, use it at your own risk._**

PFeed is currently under active development, the framework design will be prioritized first over
stability and scalability. 

Please note that the available version is a *dev* version, not a *stable* one. \
You are encouraged to play with the *dev* version, but only use it when a *stable* version is released.

> PFeed for the time being only supports [Bybit](https://bybit.com/) and Yahoo Finance for testing purpose.

## Mission
Algo-trading has always been a complicated task due to the multitude of components and procedures involved. \
Data collection and processing is probably the most mundane and yet critical part of it, as all results and findings 
are derived from the data.

However, preparing this data for use is not quick and easy. For example, sometimes even when the data is available (e.g. [Bybit data](https://public.bybit.com/trading/)), it is often in raw form and requires some cleaning.

> PFeed's mission is to **_free traders from the tedious data work_** by providing cleaned data in a standard format that is ready for use, making them significantly faster to get to the analysis and strategy development phase.


## Core Features
- [x] Unified approach for interacting with various data sources, obtaining historical and real-time data
- [x] ETL data pipline for transforming raw data and storing it in [MinIO](https://min.io/) (optional)
- [x] Utilizes [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for parallel data downloading
- [ ] Integrates with [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io) to control data flows
- [ ] Listens to PFund's trade engine and adds trade history to a local database [Timescaledb](https://www.timescale.com/) (optional)


## Installation
### Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) (Recommended)
```bash
poetry add pfeed
```

### Using Pip
```bash
pip install pfeed
```


## Quick Start
### Download Historical Data on the Command Line Interface (CLI)
```bash
# download data
pfeed download -s bybit -p BTC_USDT_PERP

# enable debug mode
pfeed download -s bybit -p BTC_USDT_PERP --debug

# list the current config:
pfeed config --list

# change the data storage location to your local project's 'data' folder:
pfeed config --data-path ./data

# for more commands:
pfeed --help
```

### Download Historical Data in Python
```python
from pfeed import bybit

bybit.download(pdts=['BTC_USDT_PERP'])
```

### Run PFeed's docker-compose.yml
```bash
# same as 'docker-compose', only difference is it has pointed to pfeed's docker-compose.yml file
pfeed docker-compose [command]

# e.g. start services
pfeed docker-compose up -d

# e.g. stop services
pfeed docker-compose down
```
