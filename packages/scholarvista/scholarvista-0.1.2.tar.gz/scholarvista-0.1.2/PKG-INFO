# ScholarVista

**ScholarVista** is a tool that extracts and plots information from a set of Academic Research Papers in PDF / TEI XML format. To process PDFs, it utilizes [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/) to generate the TEI XML files, then **ScholarVista** extracts the relevant information from the TEI XML files and generates the following data:

1. **Keyword Cloud** for each of the paper's abstract and for the total of all abstracts.
2. **Links List** for each one of the links found in the paper.
3. **Figures Histogram** comparing the number of figures per paper.

## Requirements

If you want to generate the results from a set of PDF academic papers, you must ensure that the **Grobid Service** to be installed and running in your machine. See Grobid Installation Instrucions [here](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Run-Grobid/).

If you already have the TEI XML files generated, you can directly generate the information from them.

## Install ScholarVista

### PIP

```bash
$ pip install scholarvista
```

When using **_pip_** it is a good practice to use virtual environments. Check out the official documentation on virtual envornments [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

## Using ScholarVista

### CLI Tool

The most convenient way of using **ScholarVista** is by using its CLI.

The CLI Tool will generate and save to a directory a **keyword cloud** and a **list of URLs** for each PDF analyzed, together with a **histogram** comparing the numer of figures of each PDF.

```
