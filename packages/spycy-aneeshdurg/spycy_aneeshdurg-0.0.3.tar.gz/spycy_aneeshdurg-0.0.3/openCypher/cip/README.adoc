= Cypher Improvement Proposals

This is the home for all Cypher Improvement Proposal (CIP) documents.
CIPs are documents that outline the syntax and semantics of Cypher.

== The CIP Lifecycle

CIPs normally pass through a number of phases before and after ending up in this repository.

=== Accepted

It is open to anyone to author and submit a CIP as a pull request to this repository.
The CIP should then be suggested for addition into the `accepted` directory.
It is then the task of the CLG to discuss, give feedback, and eventually (potentially) accept the CIP, at which point the pull request will be merged.

=== Testable

A CIP enters this phase when it has received a sufficient set of TCK scenarios that outline the use of its suggested features.

=== Archived

As CIPs are consumed by standard version specifications, they enter the archive.
Archived CIPs are historical records and do not have any bearing on current Cypher syntax or semantics.
