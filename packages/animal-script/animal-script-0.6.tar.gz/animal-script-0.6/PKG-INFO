### Control Statements:

**For Loop:**

Syntax: 
```bash
Monkeys <variable_name> <start> <end> [<step>]
```
Example: 
```bash
Monkeys i 0 5
```

**If Condition:**

Syntax: 
```bash
Tiger <condition>
```
Example: 
```bash
Tiger i < 10
```

**Print Statement:**

Syntax: 
```bash
Whale <message>
```
Example: 
```bash
Whale "Hello, World!"
```

**Input Statement:**

Syntax: 
```bash
Dolphin <variable_name>
```
Example: 
```bash
Dolphin age
```

**Comments:**

Syntax: 
```bash
#<comment>
```

Example: 
```bash
# This is a comment
```

**Concatenation:**

Syntax: 
```bash
<Animal> <variable_name> = <value1> + <value2>
```
Example: 
```bash
Elephants message = "Hello" + "World"
```

**If Statement with Print:**

Syntax:
```bash
Tiger <condition>
Whale <message>
```

Example:
```bash
Tiger age > 18
Whale "You are an adult"
```

**If Statement with Variable:**

Syntax:
```bash
Tiger <condition>
Dolphin <variable_name>
```

Example:
```bash
Tiger age < 18
Dolphin underage
```

**For Loop with Print:**

Syntax:
```bash
Monkeys <variable_name> <start> <end> [<step>]
Whale <message>
```

Example:
```bash
Monkeys i 1 5
Whale "Iteration: i"
```
