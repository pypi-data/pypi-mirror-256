Red Hat Product Security CLI providing:

* Set of service operations answering 'canned' product security related queries
and automating away some manual 'drudgery'
* Dynamic, extensible set of custom plugin operations for interacting with external services 
* Set of entity operations on flaws, affects, components, products, etc... for 
searching, listing and retrieving entities.

The CLI provides a 'facade' over coarse grained security related data services allowing 
for easier aggregation and narrowing of security information.
