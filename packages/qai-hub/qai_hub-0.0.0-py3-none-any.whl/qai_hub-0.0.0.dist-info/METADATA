Qualcomm速 AI Hub
================

`Qualcomm速 AI Hub <https://qaihub.qualcomm.com>`_ provides transparency into the
on-device performance of machine learning models. It allows quick examination
into key metrics to improve the model.


Tetra Hub allows users to analyze a model throught the following steps:

- Simply upload a model and submit a profiling job, targeting a specific
  device.
- The model is compiled and tailored to the target platform.
- A physical device is provisioned in the cloud. Tetra Hub analysis tools run
  the model on the device and gather metrics such as which model layers run
  on which compute units, model latency, and peak memory.
- The results are displayed on Tetra Hub, providing insights to understand
  the performance and opportunities for further improvements.

:code:`qai_hub` is a python package that provides an API for users to upload a model,
submit the profile jobs for hardware and get key metrics to optimize the
machine learning model further.


Installation with PyPI
----------------------

The easiest way to install :code:`qai_hub` is by using pip, running

:code:`pip install qai-hub`
