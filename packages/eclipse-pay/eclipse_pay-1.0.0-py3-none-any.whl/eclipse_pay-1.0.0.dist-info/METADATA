# eclipse-pay



Made by LIZARD_OFFICIAL on scratch and youtube.



## Python (Backend)





### Available currencies

```python

eclipse_pay.LRCOIN

eclipse_pay.BLOCKBIT

```





### Currently down (If attempted to create, an Exception will be raised.)

```python

eclipse_pay.BLOCKCOIN

```



### Setup with password

```python

from eclipse_pay import BLOCKBIT

from scratchattach import WsCloudEvents



bb = BLOCKBIT(id2="<id of your project>",username="griffpatch",username="griffpatch",password="SecurePassword123!") # Same for both currencies

events = WsCloudEvents(*bb.h_data)



@events.event

def on_set(event):

    bb.process(event)

```



### Setup with session id (for online IDEs)

```python

from eclipse_pay import BLOCKBIT

from scratchattach import WsCloudEvents



bb = BLOCKBIT(id2="<id of your project>",username="griffpatch",sessionid="SESSION ID HERE") # Same for both currencies

events = WsCloudEvents(*bb.h_data)



@events.event

def on_set(event):

    bb.process(event)

```





### If person1 sends person2 10 blockbits AND it was after being requested using eclipse-pay,

```python

bb.process()

```

would return

```json

{

    "sender":"person1",

    "recipient":"person2",

    "amount":"10"

}

```



while in the scratch project, the output of the api would be "1", because it simply requested to check if person1 has paid person2.





Requesting other currencies than BB and LRC

```python

from eclipse_pay import BaseCurrency

from scratchattach import WsCloudEvents



class MyCurrency(BaseCurrency):

    PROJECT_ID = "<project id of the currency>"

```

**This will only work if the give request of the currency is the same as LRC**



Now it can be created like the other currencies.
