modelcomp is a python package that helps you compare between machine learning models' performance on your dataset. It was originally developed for a microbiome research at [Borenstein Lab](http://borensteinlab.com/), Tel Aviv University.

Thanks to [Alpha program](https://www.madaney.net/en/alpha) for making this happen.


## Dependencies

modelcomp currently supports Python 3.6+.

Check out the [reqs file](https://github.com/gilramot/modelcomp/blob/master/requirements.txt) for additional package requirements.

## Installation

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/modelcomp/):

    pip install modelcomp

The current version (0.0.1a1) is the version used in the research, and thus all pre-0.0.1 versions are very unstable and may be subject to backwards incompatible changes.

Anaconda support coming soon!


## Contributing

Feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/gilramot/modelcomp/issues/new) in the package repository.


## Research

An appendix with the dataset used, results & module is available at [modelcomp-appendix](https://github.com/gilramot/modelcomp-appendix).
