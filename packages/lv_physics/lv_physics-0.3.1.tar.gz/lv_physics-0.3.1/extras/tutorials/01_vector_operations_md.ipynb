    "A **vector** is a mathematical entity that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction in 3D space. Vectors are denoted by bold letters, such as **v**.

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)\n",

    "One of the key advantages of using vector notation is the ability to express geometric relationships without having to depend on a specific coordinate system. This property is known as **coordinate independence**. When we write down calculations in terms of vectors, we are working with geometric objects that are independent of the choice of coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
