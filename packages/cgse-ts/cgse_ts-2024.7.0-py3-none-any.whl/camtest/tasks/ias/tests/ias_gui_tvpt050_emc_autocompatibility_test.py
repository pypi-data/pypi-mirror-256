        bandpass: IAS: Index in filter wheel 1 of the bandpass filter that is requested (None: white light, 1: Green, 2: Red, 3: NIR)
        ccd_code: int, CCD code associated with the position of the source. This needs to be a single value

        column : column, column position of the source. This needs to be a single position
