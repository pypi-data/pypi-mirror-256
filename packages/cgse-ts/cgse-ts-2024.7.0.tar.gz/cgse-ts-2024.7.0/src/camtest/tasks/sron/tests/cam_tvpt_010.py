    Runs the TVPT010 test described in PLATO CAM Test Plan
    Args:
        num_subpix: number of sub hexapod positions executed randomly at each FoV position (dithering)
        num_frames: number of images acquired at each sub-position
        num_bck: number of background images (shutter must be closed) acquired at the beginning of the series
        n_rows: number of rows of the appropriate CCD half to be actually read, speeds up the readout when the expected image is small
        exposure_time: integration time of each sub-position in seconds
        clearout: reset of the CCD between each image, should be true to diminish persistence risks
        dith_amp: max angular amplitude in degrees of each random sub-position of the dithering
        fwc_fraction: fraction of the pixel capacity to be filled by the incoming source intensity, regulated by the ND on the filter wheel
        fov_selection: list that allows to select a subset of the positions (theta, phi) listed in the setup file
        bandpass: if 0 or None, normal behaviour with both wheels used to obtain the requested fwc_fraction. If 1,2,3 selects green, red, NIR colors and thus reduces the range of available attenuations
        fov_table: name of the (theta, phi) positions to be used in the setup file
        description: text that will be saved along with the OBSID to identify it, should contain the test plan item identifier (such as TVPT-XXX)
