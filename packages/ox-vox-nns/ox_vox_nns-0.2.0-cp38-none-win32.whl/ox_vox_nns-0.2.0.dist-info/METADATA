# OxVoxNNS - Oxidised Voxelised Nearest Neighbour Search
A hybrid-ish nearest neighbour search implemented in rust, tailored towards consistent performance, especially on difficult inputs


# Okay but why?
Suppose we are searching for `k` neighbours within radius `r`, OxVox can operate in two different modes depending on desired behaviour and performance (see *Performance* section below).

### Inexact Mode (OxVoxApprox)
Inexact mode is the bread and butter of this module. Instead of finding the `k` *nearest* neighbours, OxVoxApprox finds `k` roughly evenly distributed neighbours within radius `r`, avoiding a lot of expensive L2 distance computations and neighbour sorting.

### Exact Mode
Exact Mode behaves like a conventional *nearest* neighbour search, with decent performance in many situations, though typically worse than open3d's highly performant NearestNeighbourSearch


# Usage
Basic usage, query a block of query points in *inexact* mode:
```
from ox_vox_nns.ox_vox_nns import OxVoxNNS

indices, distances = ox_vox_nns.OxVoxNNS(
    search_points,   # (S, 3) ndarray
    max_dist,        # float
).find_neighbours(
    query_points,    # (Q, 3) ndarray
    num_neighbours,  # int
    False,           # False => inexact mode
)
```

More complex usage, using a single NNS object for multiple *exact* mode queries (e.g. to distribute the `nns` object and perform queries in parallel, or to query from a large number of query points in batches/chunks)
```
from ox_vox_nns.ox_vox_nns import OxVoxNNS

nns = ox_vox_nns.OxVoxNNS(
    search_points,
    max_dist,
    voxel_size,
)

for query_points_chunk in query_points_chunks:
    chunk_indices, chunk_distances = nns.find_neighbours(
        query_points,
        num_neighbours,
        True,
    )
```

# Installation
## Precompiled (from PyPI)
Currently only available for linux x86-64
```
pip install ox_vox_nns
```

## Manual
Checkout this repo and enter a virtual environment, then run
```
maturin develop --release
```

# Performance
See `performance_test_ox_vox_nns.py` for test code.

Rough testing suggests that OxVoxNNS outperforms KDTrees under certain circumstances, particularly with higher numbers of query points. Rigourous testing is a WIP
