# Higher Order Interpolation in 3D for Torch

## Overview
This is a small library that allows a more general interpolation in 3D, using higher order polynomial basis, which Pytorch's [torch.nn.functional.interpolate()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.ao.nn.quantized.functional.interpolate.html) currently does not offer. 

## Key Features:

Fast
- Highly performant on any device

CPU and GPU compatible 
- Can run on both CPU and GPU's 

Integrated with PyTorch
- Can integrate with the PyTorch interface
