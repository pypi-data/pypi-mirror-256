[![Test](https://github.com/ansibleguy/ansible-webui/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=latest)](https://github.com/ansibleguy/ansible-webui/actions/workflows/test.yml)



The goal is to allow users to quickly install & run a WebUI for using Ansible locally.

This is achieved by [distributing it using pip](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-webui/).

Keep it simple.

**This project is still in early development! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!**

## Comparison

There are multiple Ansible WebUI products - how do they compare to this product?

* **[Ansible AWX](https://www.ansible.com/community/awx-project) / [Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/pricing)**

   If you want an enterprise-grade solution - you might want to use these official products.

   They have many neat features and are designed to run in containerized & scalable environments.

   The actual enterprise solution named 'Ansible Automation Platform' can be pretty expensive.


* **[Ansible Semaphore](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore)**

   Semaphore is a pretty lightweight WebUI for Ansible.

   It is a single binary and built from Golang (backend) and Node.js/Vue.js (frontend).

   Ansible job execution is done using [custom implementation](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore/blob/develop/db_lib/AnsiblePlaybook.go).

   The project is [managed by a single maintainer and has some issues](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore/discussions/1111). It seems to develop in the direction of large-scale containerized deployments.

   The 'Ansible-WebUI' project was inspired by Semaphore.


* **This project**

   It is built to be lightweight.

   As Ansible already requires Python3 - I chose it as primary language.

   The backend stack is built of [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the frontend consists of Django templates and basic/vanilla JS.

   Ansible job execution is done using the official [ansible-runner](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/runner/en/latest/python_interface/) library!

   Target users are small to medium businesses and Ansible users which just want a UI to run their playbooks.
