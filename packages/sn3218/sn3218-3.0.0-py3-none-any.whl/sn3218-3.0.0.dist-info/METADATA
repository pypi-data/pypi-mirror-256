# Pre-requisites

You must enable:

* i2c: `sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0`

You can optionally run `sudo raspi-config` or the graphical Raspberry Pi Configuration UI to enable interfaces.

# Installing

Stable library from PyPi:

* Just run `python3 -m pip install sn3218`

In most cases you'll need to run this in a virtual Python environment.

Latest/development library from GitHub:

* `git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/sn3218-python`
* `cd sn3218-python`
* `./install.sh --unstable`
